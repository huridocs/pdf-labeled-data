<text top="635" left="34" width="528" height="11" font="1">have registered for that purpose with eBay and have created a seller’s account with it. eBay charges a percentage</text>

<text top="658" left="36" width="526" height="11" font="1">    eBay  enables  prospective  buyers  to  bid  for  items  offered  by  sellers.  It  also  allows  items  to  be  sold  without  an</text>

<text top="714" left="35" width="526" height="11" font="1"> In some cases eBay assists sellers in order to enhance their offers for sale, to set up online shops, to promote and</text>

<text top="73" left="36" width="525" height="11" font="1">    It  is  common  ground  between  L’Oréal  and  eBay  that  two  of  those  17  items  are  counterfeits  of  goods  bearing</text>
<text top="84" left="34" width="93" height="11" font="1">L’Oréal trade marks.</text>
<text top="95" left="35" width="527" height="11" font="1"> Although L’Oréal does not claim that the other 15 items are counterfeits, it none the less considers that the sale of</text>
<text top="107" left="34" width="528" height="11" font="1">the items infringed its trade mark rights, since those items were either goods that were not intended for sale (such</text>
<text top="118" left="34" width="527" height="11" font="1">as tester or dramming products) or goods bearing L’Oréal trade marks intended for sale in North America and not</text>
<text top="129" left="34" width="462" height="11" font="1">in the European Economic Area (‘EEA’). Furthermore, some of the items were sold without packaging.</text>
<text top="140" left="35" width="527" height="11" font="1">  Whilst refraining from ruling at this stage on the question as to the extent to which L’Oréal’s trade mark rights</text>
<text top="152" left="34" width="527" height="11" font="1">have  been  infringed,  the  High  Court  of  Justice  has  confirmed  that  the  individual  defendants  made  the  sales</text>
<text top="163" left="34" width="243" height="11" font="1">described by L’Oréal on the website www.ebay.co.uk.</text>
<text top="174" left="36" width="526" height="11" font="1"> Second, L’Oréal submits that eBay is liable for the use of L’Oréal trade marks where those marks are displayed on</text>
<text top="185" left="34" width="528" height="11" font="1">eBay’s website and where sponsored links triggered by the use of keywords corresponding to the trade marks are</text>
<text top="197" left="34" width="319" height="11" font="1">displayed on the websites of search engine operators, such as Google.</text>
<text top="208" left="35" width="527" height="11" font="1"> Concerning the last point, it is not disputed that eBay, by choosing keywords corresponding to L’Oréal trade marks</text>
<text top="219" left="34" width="528" height="11" font="1">in Google’s ‘Ad Words’ referencing service, caused to be displayed, each time that there was a match between a</text>
<text top="230" left="34" width="527" height="11" font="1">keyword  and  the  word  entered  in  Google’s  search  engine  by  an  internet  user,  a  sponsored  link  to  the  site</text>
<text top="242" left="34" width="527" height="11" font="1">www.ebay.co.uk. That link would appear in the ‘sponsored links’ section displayed on either the right-hand side, or</text>
<text top="253" left="34" width="243" height="11" font="1">on the upper part, of the screen displayed by Google.</text>
<text top="264" left="36" width="525" height="11" font="1"> Thus, on 27 March 2007, when an internet user entered the words ‘shu uemura’ – which in essence coincide with</text>
<text top="275" left="34" width="527" height="11" font="1">L’Oréal’s  national  word  mark  ‘Shu  Uemura’  –  as  a  search  string  in  the  Google  search  engine,  the  following  eBay</text>
<text top="287" left="34" width="278" height="11" font="1">advertisement was displayed in the ‘sponsored links’ section:</text>

<text top="343" left="34" width="527" height="11" font="1">  Clicking on that sponsored link led to a page on the www.ebay.co.uk website which showed ‘96 items found for</text>
<text top="354" left="34" width="361" height="11" font="1">shu uemura’. Most of those items were expressly stated to be from Hong Kong.</text>
<text top="365" left="36" width="525" height="11" font="1"> Similarly, taking one of the other examples, when, on 27 March 2007, an internet user entered the words ‘matrix</text>
<text top="377" left="34" width="527" height="11" font="1">hair’,  which  correspond  in  part  to  L’Oréal’s  national  word  mark  ‘Matrix’,  as  a  search  string  in  the  Google  search</text>

<text top="444" left="35" width="526" height="11" font="1"> Third, L’Oréal has claimed that, even if eBay was not liable for the infringements of its trade mark rights, it should</text>
<text top="455" left="34" width="374" height="11" font="1">be granted an injunction against eBay by virtue of Article 11 of Directive 2004/48.</text>
<text top="467" left="36" width="525" height="11" font="1">    L’Oréal  reached  a  settlement  with  some  of  the  individual  defendants  (Mr  Potts,  Ms  Ratchford,  Ms  Ormsby,  Mr</text>
<text top="478" left="34" width="528" height="11" font="1">Clarke and Ms Clarke) and obtained judgment in default against the others (Mr Fox and Ms Bi). Subsequently, in</text>
<text top="489" left="34" width="463" height="11" font="1">March 2009, a hearing dealing with the action against eBay was held before the High Court of Justice.</text>
<text top="500" left="36" width="526" height="11" font="1"> By judgment of 22 May 2009, the High Court of Justice made a number of findings of fact and concluded that the</text>
<text top="512" left="34" width="528" height="11" font="1">state of the proceedings did not permit final judgment in the case, as a number of questions of law first required an</text>
<text top="523" left="34" width="285" height="11" font="1">interpretation from the Court of Justice of the European Union.</text>
<text top="534" left="35" width="526" height="11" font="1">  In its judgment, the High Court of Justice notes that eBay has installed filters in order to detect listings which</text>
<text top="545" left="34" width="528" height="11" font="1">might  contravene  the  conditions  of  use  of  the  site.  That  court  also  notes  that  eBay  has  developed,  using  a</text>
<text top="557" left="34" width="528" height="11" font="1">programme  called  ‘VeRO’  (<i>Verified  Rights  Owner</i>),  a  notice  and  take-down  system  that  is  intended  to  provide</text>
<text top="568" left="34" width="527" height="11" font="1">intellectual  property  owners  with  assistance  in  removing  infringing  listings  from  the  marketplace.  L’Oréal  has</text>
<text top="579" left="34" width="445" height="11" font="1">declined to participate in the VeRO programme, contending that the programme is unsatisfactory.</text>
<text top="590" left="35" width="526" height="11" font="1"> The High Court of Justice has also stated that eBay applies sanctions, such as the temporary – or even permanent</text>
<text top="602" left="34" width="428" height="11" font="1">– suspension of sellers who have contravened the conditions of use of the online marketplace.</text>
<text top="613" left="36" width="526" height="11" font="1"> Despite the findings set out above, the High Court of Justice took the view that eBay could do more to reduce the</text>
<text top="624" left="34" width="528" height="11" font="1">number of sales on its online marketplace which infringe intellectual property rights. According to that court, eBay</text>
<text top="635" left="34" width="528" height="11" font="1">could use additional filters. It could also include in its rules a prohibition on selling, without the consent of the trade</text>
<text top="647" left="34" width="528" height="11" font="1">mark proprietors, trade-marked goods originating from outside the EEA. It could also impose additional restrictions</text>
<text top="658" left="34" width="451" height="11" font="1">on the volumes of products that can be listed at any one time and apply sanctions more rigorously.</text>
<text top="669" left="34" width="527" height="11" font="1">  The High Court of Justice states, however, that the fact that it would be possible for eBay to do more does not</text>
<text top="680" left="34" width="230" height="11" font="1">necessarily mean that it is legally obliged to do so.</text>
<text top="692" left="34" width="527" height="11" font="1"> By decision of 16 July 2009, which follows on from the judgment of 22 May 2009, the High Court of Justice decided</text>
<text top="703" left="34" width="428" height="11" font="1">to stay the proceedings and refer the following questions to the Court for a preliminary ruling:</text>

<text top="264" left="34" width="528" height="11" font="1">concluded  that  an  offer  for  sale  or  an  advertisement  displayed  on  an  online  marketplace  accessible  from  the</text>
<text top="275" left="34" width="354" height="11" font="1">territory covered by the trade mark is targeted at consumers in that territory.</text>
<text top="287" left="34" width="250" height="11" font="1"> 3. The offer for sale of testers and dramming products</text>
<text top="298" left="35" width="527" height="11" font="1"> It is common ground that, at the time of the facts considered by the referring court, the individual defendants also</text>
<text top="309" left="34" width="528" height="11" font="1">offered for sale, on the website www.ebay.co.uk, testers and dramming items which L’Oréal had supplied free of</text>
<text top="320" left="34" width="165" height="11" font="1">charge to its authorised distributors.</text>
<text top="332" left="36" width="526" height="11" font="1"> By its first question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether the supply by the proprietor of a trade mark of</text>
<text top="343" left="34" width="528" height="11" font="1">items bearing that mark, intended for demonstration to consumers in authorised retail outlets, and of bottles also</text>
<text top="354" left="34" width="528" height="11" font="1">bearing the mark from which small quantities can be taken for supply to consumers as free samples amounts to</text>
<text top="365" left="34" width="469" height="11" font="1">those goods being put on the market within the meaning of Directive 89/104 and Regulation No 40/94.</text>
<text top="377" left="38" width="524" height="11" font="1"> The referring court found in that regard that L’Oréal had clearly indicated to its authorised distributors that they</text>
<text top="388" left="34" width="404" height="11" font="1">could not sell such items and bottles, which in any case were often marked ‘not for sale’.</text>
<text top="399" left="36" width="526" height="11" font="1"> As the Court has already held, where the proprietor of a trade mark affixes that mark to items that it gives away,</text>
<text top="410" left="34" width="528" height="11" font="1">free of charge, in order to promote the sale of its goods, those items are not distributed in any way with the aim of</text>

<text top="422" left="226" width="336" height="11" font="1">495/07 <i>Silberquelle</i> [2009] ECR I-137, paragraphs 20 to 22). Where such</text>
<text top="433" left="34" width="528" height="11" font="1">items are supplied free of charge, they thus cannot, as a rule, be regarded as being put on the market by the trade</text>
<text top="444" left="34" width="75" height="11" font="1">mark proprietor.</text>
<text top="455" left="36" width="526" height="11" font="1"> The Court has also stated that when a trade mark proprietor marks items such as perfume testers with the words</text>
<text top="467" left="34" width="528" height="11" font="1">‘demonstration’ or ‘not for sale’, that precludes, in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, a finding that that</text>
<text top="478" left="34" width="527" height="11" font="1">proprietor  impliedly  consented  to  those  items  being  put  on  the  market  (see  <i>Coty  Prestige  Lancaster  Group</i>,</text>
<text top="489" left="34" width="125" height="11" font="1">paragraphs 43, 46 and 48).</text>
<text top="500" left="35" width="527" height="11" font="1"> Accordingly, the answer to the first question is that where the proprietor of a trade mark supplies to its authorised</text>
<text top="512" left="34" width="528" height="11" font="1">distributors  items  bearing  that  mark,  intended  for  demonstration  to  consumers  in  authorised  retail  outlets,  and</text>
<text top="523" left="34" width="528" height="11" font="1">bottles bearing the mark from which small quantities can be taken for supply to consumers as free samples, those</text>
<text top="534" left="34" width="528" height="11" font="1">goods, in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, are not put on the market within the meaning of Directive</text>
<text top="545" left="34" width="152" height="11" font="1">89/104 and Regulation No 40/94.</text>
<text top="557" left="34" width="165" height="11" font="1"> 4. The marketing of unboxed goods</text>
<text top="568" left="34" width="528" height="11" font="1">  As has been explained in paragraphs 36, 37 and 51 of this judgment, some of the items bearing L’Oréal’s trade</text>
<text top="579" left="34" width="413" height="11" font="1">marks were sold, by sellers operating by means of eBay’s marketplace, without packaging.</text>
<text top="590" left="38" width="524" height="11" font="1"> By its second to fourth questions, the referring court seeks, in essence, to ascertain whether the removal of the</text>
<text top="602" left="34" width="527" height="11" font="1">packaging of goods such as those at issue in the main proceedings infringes the exclusive right of the proprietor of</text>
<text top="613" left="34" width="528" height="11" font="1">the trade mark affixed to those goods, thus entitling the proprietor to oppose the resale of goods whose packaging</text>
<text top="624" left="34" width="100" height="11" font="1">has been so removed.</text>
<text top="635" left="36" width="526" height="11" font="1"> In view of the fact that the unboxed goods at issue in the main proceedings are, for the most part, cosmetics, the</text>
<text top="647" left="34" width="528" height="11" font="1">referring  court  requests  that  these  questions  be  answered  in  the  light  of  Article  6(1)  of  Directive  76/768,  under</text>
<text top="658" left="34" width="528" height="11" font="1">which cosmetic products may be marketed only if the container and packaging mention, inter alia, the identity of</text>
<text top="669" left="34" width="527" height="11" font="1">the manufacturer or the person responsible for marketing the product, the composition of the product (content and</text>
<text top="680" left="34" width="528" height="11" font="1">list  of  ingredients),  the  use  of  the  product  (function  and  particular  precautions  to  be  observed  in  use)  and</text>
<text top="692" left="34" width="528" height="11" font="1">preservation of the product (date of minimum durability). In that regard, it seeks, in essence, to ascertain whether</text>
<text top="703" left="34" width="527" height="11" font="1">the  proprietor  of  a  trade  mark  may,  by  virtue  of  its  exclusive  right  under  Directive  89/104  or,  in  the  case  of  a</text>

<text top="725" left="34" width="399" height="11" font="1">sales take place without the requirements of Article 6(1) of Directive 76/768 being met.</text>
<text top="737" left="37" width="525" height="11" font="1"> L’Oréal submits, as do the French, Polish and Portuguese Governments and the Commission, that, irrespective of</text>
<text top="748" left="34" width="528" height="11" font="1">whether  or  not  there  is  an  infringement  of  Directive  76/768,  the  packaging  is  an  essential  part  of  the  image  of</text>
<text top="759" left="34" width="527" height="11" font="1">perfumes and cosmetics. The proprietor of the trade mark affixed to those goods and to their packaging should, as</text>
<text top="770" left="34" width="528" height="11" font="1">a consequence, be able to oppose the resale of those goods in an unboxed state. By contrast, eBay argues that, in</text>
<text top="782" left="34" width="528" height="11" font="1">the perfumes and cosmetics sector, it is often the bottle or the product’s container, and not the packaging, which</text>

<text top="50" left="34" width="527" height="11" font="1">must be examined on a case-by-case basis. As the Advocate General observed at points 71 to 74 of his Opinion,</text>
<text top="62" left="34" width="528" height="11" font="1">where perfumes or cosmetics are displayed without packaging, that may sometimes effectively convey the image of</text>
<text top="73" left="34" width="527" height="11" font="1">the product as a prestige or luxury product, whilst, in other cases, removing the packaging has precisely the effect</text>
<text top="84" left="34" width="105" height="11" font="1">of harming that image.</text>
<text top="95" left="38" width="524" height="11" font="1">    Such  damage  may  occur  when  the  packaging  is  as  important  as,  or  more  important  than,  the  bottle  or  the</text>

<text top="523" left="30" width="144" height="11" font="1">what those measures might be.</text>
<text top="534" left="36" width="526" height="11" font="1"> eBay submits that an injunction within the meaning of Article 11 of Directive 2004/48 may relate only to specific</text>

<text top="568" left="34" width="498" height="11" font="1">directive may also deal with the prevention of future infringements, provided that certain limits are observed.</text>
<text top="579" left="37" width="524" height="11" font="1">As it results from the order for reference, the question referred concerns, in particular, the third sentence of Article</text>
<text top="590" left="34" width="527" height="11" font="1">11 of Directive 2004/48, according to which the Member States must ensure ‘that rightholders are in a position to</text>

<text top="703" left="34" width="527" height="11" font="1">the  word  ‘injunction’  in  the  third  sentence  of  Article  11  differs  considerably  from  the  use,  in  the  first  sentence</text>

<text top="737" left="36" width="525" height="11" font="1"> As the Polish Government in particular observed, that difference can be explained by the fact that an injunction</text>
<text top="748" left="34" width="527" height="11" font="1">against an infringer entails, logically, preventing that person from continuing the infringement, whilst the situation</text>
<text top="759" left="34" width="528" height="11" font="1">of the service provider by means of which the infringement is committed is more complex and lends itself to other</text>

<text top="782" left="36" width="525" height="11" font="1"> For that reason, an ‘injunction’ as referred to in the third sentence of Article 11 of Directive 2004/48 cannot be</text>

<text top="467" left="35" width="527" height="11" font="1"> First, it follows from Article 15(1) of Directive 2000/31, in conjunction with Article 2(3) of Directive 2004/48, that</text>
<text top="478" left="34" width="527" height="11" font="1">the  measures  required  of  the  online  service  provider  concerned  cannot  consist  in  an  active  monitoring  of  all  the</text>
<text top="489" left="34" width="528" height="11" font="1">data  of  each  of  its  customers  in  order  to  prevent  any  future  infringement  of  intellectual  property  rights  via  that</text>
<text top="500" left="34" width="528" height="11" font="1">provider’s website. Furthermore, a general monitoring obligation would be incompatible with Article 3 of Directive</text>
<text top="512" left="34" width="528" height="11" font="1">2004/48, which states that the measures referred to by the directive must be fair and proportionate and must not</text>
<text top="523" left="34" width="98" height="11" font="1">be excessively costly.</text>
<text top="534" left="35" width="527" height="11" font="1"> Second, as is also clear from Article 3 of Directive 2004/48, the court issuing the injunction must ensure that the</text>
<text top="545" left="34" width="527" height="11" font="1">measures laid down do not create barriers to legitimate trade. That implies that, in a case such as that before the</text>
<text top="557" left="34" width="527" height="11" font="1">referring court, which concerns possible infringements of trade marks in the context of a service provided by the</text>
<text top="568" left="34" width="527" height="11" font="1">operator of an online marketplace, the injunction obtained against that operator cannot have as its object or effect</text>
<text top="579" left="34" width="500" height="11" font="1">a general and permanent prohibition on the selling, on that marketplace, of goods bearing those trade marks.</text>
<text top="590" left="37" width="524" height="11" font="1">    Despite  the  limitations  described  in  the  preceding  paragraphs,  injunctions  which  are  both  effective  and</text>
<text top="602" left="34" width="527" height="11" font="1">proportionate may be issued against providers such as operators of online marketplaces. As the Advocate General</text>
<text top="613" left="34" width="527" height="11" font="1">stated at point 182 of his Opinion, if the operator of the online marketplace does not decide, on its own initiative, to</text>
<text top="624" left="34" width="528" height="11" font="1">suspend the perpetrator of the infringement of intellectual property rights in order to prevent further infringements</text>
<text top="635" left="34" width="528" height="11" font="1">of that kind by the same seller in respect of the same trade marks, it may be ordered, by means of an injunction,</text>
<text top="647" left="34" width="40" height="11" font="1">to do so.</text>
<text top="658" left="37" width="525" height="11" font="1"> Furthermore, in order to ensure that there is a right to an effective remedy against persons who have used an</text>
<text top="669" left="34" width="527" height="11" font="1">online service to infringe intellectual property rights, the operator of an online marketplace may be ordered to take</text>
<text top="680" left="34" width="528" height="11" font="1">measures to make it easier to identify its customer-sellers. In that regard, as L’Oréal has rightly submitted in its</text>
<text top="692" left="34" width="528" height="11" font="1">written observations and as follows from Article 6 of Directive 2000/31, although it is certainly necessary to respect</text>
<text top="703" left="34" width="528" height="11" font="1">the protection of personal data, the fact remains that when the infringer is operating in the course of trade and not</text>
<text top="714" left="34" width="272" height="11" font="1">in a private matter, that person must be clearly identifiable.</text>
<text top="725" left="36" width="525" height="11" font="1"> The measures that are described (non-exhaustively) in the preceding paragraphs, as well as any other measure</text>
<text top="737" left="34" width="528" height="11" font="1">which  may  be  imposed  in  the  form  of  an  injunction  under  the  third  sentence  of  Article  11  of  Directive  2004/48,</text>
<text top="748" left="34" width="527" height="11" font="1">must strike a fair balance between the various rights and interests mentioned above (see, by analogy, <i>Promusicae</i>,</text>
<text top="759" left="34" width="100" height="11" font="1">paragraphs 65 to 68).</text>
<text top="770" left="38" width="524" height="11" font="1">  In  view  of  the  foregoing,  the  answer  to  the  tenth  question  is  that  the  third  sentence  of  Article  11  of  Directive</text>
<text top="782" left="34" width="528" height="11" font="1">2004/48 must be interpreted as requiring the Member States to ensure that the national courts with jurisdiction in</text>

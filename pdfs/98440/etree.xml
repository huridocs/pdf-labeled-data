<text top="242" left="57" width="4" height="13" font="0"> </text>
<text top="254" left="57" width="487" height="13" font="0">2.The petitioners allege that the incidents reported in the complaint constitute a violation of </text>

<text top="315" left="57" width="487" height="13" font="0">that no violations of the American Convention are involved, since Mr. Martín del Campo had </text>
<text top="327" left="57" width="486" height="13" font="0">access to several courts of law and proceedings wherein due process was respected and torture </text>
<text top="339" left="57" width="485" height="13" font="0">was not proven, and because his conviction stands as<i>res judicata</i>and as such cannot be reviewed </text>

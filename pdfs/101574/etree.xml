<item page="1">I. SUMMARY</item>
<item page="1">The petitioners allege that the Guatemalan State is responsible for violation of the rights established in Articles 4 (right to life), 5 (right to humane treatment), 8 (right to a fair trial), 11 (right to privacy), 24 (right to equal protection), and...</item>
<item page="1">The State for its part maintains that appropriate domestic remedies have not been pursued and exhausted, and that consequently the petition should be declared inadmissible.  It further contends that the investigation has not been concluded, that the P...</item>
<item page="1">Without prejudice to the merits of the case, after examining the positions of the parties, and in compliance with the requirements stipulated in Articles 46 and 47 of the American Convention, the Commission has decided to declare the case admissible f...</item>
<item page="2">PROCEDURES BEFORE THE COMMISSION</item>
<item page="2">On December 10, 2007, the Commission received the petition and assigned it number 1560-07.  On March 16, 2010, the IACHR forwarded the pertinent parts of the petition to the State of Guatemala, requesting it to submit its response within two months, i...</item>
<item page="2">The petitioners allege that the State of Guatemala failed in its duty to investigate with due diligence the murder of Claudina Isabel Velásquez, a 19-year old law student, and they contend that the case continues to go unpunished.  They report that th...</item>
<item page="2">They report that Claudina Isabel Velásquez disappeared on August 12, 2005.  They indicate that the last communication with her family was at 11:45 pm on that day, when she told them that she was at a party and that she would be home after midnight.  T...</item>
<item page="2">According to the petitioners, the parents, next-of-kin, and friends continued to search for Claudina Isabel Velásquez, when at 10:30 am on that same day, family members received a call from a friend who reported that an unidentified body with the char...</item>
<item page="2">They report that during the wake, officials of the Public Ministry belonging to the Group of Crime Scene Specialists appeared to take the fingerprints of the corpse.  They indicate that the family felt offended and humiliated by this, since this type ...</item>
<item page="2">As regards an investigation into the facts, they report that there was no inquiry or investigative measures during the first forty-eight hours.  They maintain that the Public Ministry interviewed the parents of the alleged victim forty days after the ...</item>
<item page="3">They point to a series of irregularities in the investigation into the case on the part of the government agencies, that gave rise to the continued impunity.  They maintain that the body was located on August 13, 2005 at 5:30 am in zone 11 of Guatemal...</item>
<item page="3">They add that the forensic medical report submitted 17 days after the fact had a series of defects including the following ones:  no determination of the time of death; failure to note blood spots and wounds reported in the photographs; no indication ...</item>
<item page="3">They point out that these deficiencies were largely due to the fact that the persons responsible for investigating the scene of the crime did not feel that they had to pursue an investigation, because in their opinion the alleged victim—due to the low...</item>
<item page="3">They argue that the murder of the alleged victim is not an isolated incident, but is part of a pattern of violence against women in Guatemala, which in recent years has led to a dramatic increase in the number of murders for reasons of gender.  They i...</item>
<item page="3">They contend that the irregularities in the investigation into the murder of Claudina Isabel were reported to the Supervisory Office of the Public Ministry, which issued a report in May 2006  acknowledging that the victim, her parents, and her next of...</item>
<item page="4">As for the family of Claudina Isabel, they contend that it has encountered a justice system that has done everything it could to make them desist in their efforts to find the guilty parties.  Since the start of the investigation, they report that the ...</item>
<item page="4">With regard to the exhaustion of domestic remedies, they allege that a number of years have gone by since the murder of Claudina Isabel Velásquez and the case continues to be in the investigative stage.  Despite the family’s efforts, and especially th...</item>
<item page="4">B.  The State</item>
<item page="4">The State alleges that the death of Claudina Isabel Velásquez occurred on Saturday August 13, 2005, between 2:12 am and 5:00 am, based on a call made to the 110 number of the National Civilian Police reporting a possible rape, and on the statement of ...</item>
<item page="4">Between the time of the disappearance and death of Claudina Velásquez and now, the State reports that various steps have been taken by the Public Ministry and different lines of investigation have been followed.  The State maintains that the Public Mi...</item>
<item page="4">It indicates that among the activities carried out by the Presidential Commission coordinating the Executive Policy on Human Rights, COPREDEH, it met with the prosecutor’s office in charge of the case and determined the procedures carried out, checkin...</item>
<item page="4">It alleges that there are investigative activities that cannot be mentioned, since they would slow down the investigation being conducted by the prosecution.  However, the steps taken by the Public Ministry so far demonstrate the State’s interest and ...</item>
<item page="4">With regard to the issue of exhaustion of domestic remedies, the State argues that domestic remedies have not been exhausted, and consequently the petition should be declared inadmissible.  The State argues that the criminal investigation is still und...</item>
<item page="5">IV. ANALYSIS OF ADMISSIBILITY</item>
<item page="5">Competence of the Commission ratione personæ, ratione loci, ratione temporis and ratione materiæ</item>
<item page="5">In principle, petitioners are authorized to lodge petitions with the  Commission under Article 44 of the American Convention.  The petition indicates that the alleged victims are four individuals in respect of whom the State of Guatemala pledged to re...</item>
<item page="5">The Commission has temporal jurisdiction, since the obligation to respect and guarantee the rights protected in the American Convention and the Convention of Belém do Pará was already in effect for the State on the date that the acts alleged in the pe...</item>
<item page="5">Other requirements for admissibility of the petition</item>
<item page="5">1. Exhaustion of domestic remedies</item>
<item page="5">Article 46.1 of the American Convention establishes that, in order for a petition lodged with the Inter-American Commission to be admissible pursuant to Article 44 of the Convention, remedies under domestic law must have been pursued and exhausted, in...</item>
<item page="5">In the present case, the State argues that the remedies under domestic law have not been pursued and exhausted, and that the criminal investigation is still open.  Whenever a state alleges that remedies under domestic law have not been exhausted, it h...</item>
<item page="5">The petitioners indicate that five years have lapsed since the murder of Claudina Isabel Velásquez, and that the case is still in the investigation stage.  This, despite the efforts on the part of the family, and especially her father, who became a co...</item>
<item page="6">Without going into an analysis of the arguments put forward by the parties with regard to the alleged violation of the right to a fair trial and judicial protection, the Commission notes that during the five years that have elapsed between the time Cl...</item>
<item page="6">The Inter-American Commission further notes that the petitioners allege that the facts of this case have occurred in a situation in which there have been numerous murders and disappearances of women in Guatemala, and that most of these cases have not ...</item>
<item page="6">Consequently, the Inter-American Commission establishes, for purposes of admissibility, that with respect to the facts of this petition, there has been an unwarranted delay on the part of the Guatemalan judicial organs.  Thus the IACHR concludes that ...</item>
<item page="6">2. Deadline for filing the petition</item>
<item page="6">According to the requirement stipulated in Article 46.1.b of the Convention, according to which the petition must be lodged within six months following the date on which the victim was notified of the final decision that exhausted the domestic remedie...</item>
<item page="6">3.  Duplication of international procedures and res judicata</item>
<item page="6">The case records do not show that the subject of the petition is pending other international settlement procedures, or that it replicates a petition already examined by this or another international organization.  Therefore, the requirements set forth...</item>
<item page="6">4.  Characterization of the alleged facts</item>
<item page="6">The Commission is of the view that at this stage of the procedure, it is not appropriate for it to decide whether or not alleged violations occurred to the detriment of the alleged victims.  For purposes of admissibility, at this point the IACHR must ...</item>
<item page="7">The standard for evaluation of these points of law is different from that required in deciding the merits of a petition.  In a prima facie evaluation, the Commission must determine whether the petition establishes the basis for an apparent or potentia...</item>
<item page="7">In this regard, the IACHR considers that the alleged facts pertaining to Claudina Isabel Velásquez, if proven true, would characterize potential violations of the rights guaranteed in Articles 5, 11, and 24 of the American Convention, considered in co...</item>
<item page="7">The IACHR further decides to declare the case admissible insofar as the alleged violation of the rights established in Articles 5.1, 8.1, and 25 are concerned, considered in accordance with Article 1.1 of that instrument, in respect of Jorge Rolando V...</item>
<item page="7">CONCLUSIONS</item>
<item page="7">The Inter-American Commission concludes that it is competent to examine the merits of this case and that the petition is admissible, in accordance with Articles 46 and 47 of the American Convention, and decides to continue with an analysis of the meri...</item>
<item page="7">It also concludes that the petition is inadmissible regarding alleged violations of the rights enshrined in Articles 11 and 24 of the American Convention, with respect to Jorge Rolando Velásquez Durán, Elsa Claudina Paiz Vidal de Velásquez and Pablo A...</item>
<item page="8">On the basis of the above-mentioned arguments of fact and law,</item>

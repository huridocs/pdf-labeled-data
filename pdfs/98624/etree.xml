<text top="506" left="57" width="503" height="13" font="2">by the police. After 23 days in detention, a detention order was issued for Mr. Chaparro, despite </text>

<text top="482" left="57" width="503" height="13" font="2">containers.” Not having any relation with the drug that was found, Mr. Chaparro willingly agreed </text>
<text top="494" left="57" width="503" height="13" font="2">to accompany them, thinking that he could provide them assistance since he was the owner of a </text>
<text top="506" left="57" width="409" height="13" font="2">company, the Plumavit Factory, which produced Styrofoam products in Ecuador. </text>
<text top="518" left="57" width="4" height="13" font="2"> </text>
<text top="530" left="57" width="502" height="13" font="2">11. The morning of the same day that he was arrested, unbeknownst to Mr. Chaparro, his Factory </text>
<text top="543" left="57" width="504" height="13" font="2">was illegally and arbitrarily searched, and the police proceeded to detain all the workers and </text>
<text top="555" left="57" width="505" height="13" font="2">employees whom they found working extra hours on that Saturday.  No arrest warrants were </text>
<text top="567" left="57" width="504" height="13" font="2">shown, and Mr. Freddy Lapo, the Production Manager, requested Captain Peralta to produce a </text>
<text top="579" left="57" width="503" height="13" font="2">search warrant. The Captain, pulling out his pistol, retorted that “with this and 400 kilos of drugs </text>
<text top="591" left="57" width="503" height="13" font="2">in the airport I have the right to search where I want”. Mr. Lapo, two mechanics and the man in </text>

<text top="640" left="57" width="503" height="13" font="2">12. Mr. Chaparro, and the workers from his factory, were taken to the police station, where they </text>
<text top="652" left="57" width="505" height="13" font="2">were locked in individual cells and held incommunicado for five days.  They were not even </text>
<text top="664" left="57" width="505" height="13" font="2">permitted to make a phone call during that time.  During those five days Mr. Chaparro was </text>
<text top="676" left="57" width="503" height="13" font="2">interrogated in the police office without the presence of his lawyer. The petition states that this </text>
<text top="688" left="57" width="503" height="13" font="2">fact can be corroborated by Dr. Marcelo Santos Vera, former Minister of Government of Ecuador, </text>
<text top="700" left="57" width="502" height="13" font="2">and who having learned of his situation came to see him with his wife and Mr. Joaquín Martínez, a </text>

<text top="56" left="57" width="504" height="13" font="2">came to see him, an individual who is not a criminal lawyer and allegedly not the appropriate </text>
<text top="69" left="57" width="504" height="13" font="2">person to defend him, in the opinion of Mr. Chaparro, but a person who can be considered a </text>
<text top="81" left="57" width="439" height="13" font="2">witness to the fact that he was interrogated without the presence of a defense lawyer. </text>
<text top="93" left="57" width="4" height="13" font="2"> </text>
<text top="105" left="57" width="504" height="13" font="2">13.  As a consequence, Mr. Chaparro was informed that the police, in an arbitrary and illegal </text>
<text top="117" left="57" width="502" height="13" font="2">manner, was attempting to involve him in an antinarcotics operation known as the “Rivera Case.” </text>
<text top="129" left="57" width="503" height="13" font="2">According to the petition, Mr. Chaparro’s involvement was alleged to have been as the supplier of </text>
<text top="141" left="57" width="502" height="13" font="2">the styrofoam containers, in which, under the pretext of exporting fish, smaller plastic boxes filled </text>
<text top="154" left="57" width="503" height="13" font="2">with drugs were found. Mr. Chaparro asserts that his detention was based on a mistake both of </text>
<text top="166" left="57" width="503" height="13" font="2">the police and the Judge in charge of the case, and alleges that this is a clear violation of the </text>
<text top="178" left="57" width="504" height="13" font="2">principal of the presumption of innocence set forth in the American Convention.  When he was </text>
<text top="190" left="57" width="503" height="13" font="2">permitted to see one of the containers seized in the operation he could tell that the thickness of </text>
<text top="202" left="57" width="502" height="13" font="2">the bottom was much greater than in the containers that his factory produced. Further, the marks </text>
<text top="214" left="57" width="502" height="13" font="2">that are left by injecting the raw material do not correspond to those made by the machines in his </text>
<text top="226" left="57" width="506" height="13" font="2">factory.  Mr. Chaparro requested that Captain Peralta request an expert from a prestigious </text>
<text top="239" left="57" width="502" height="13" font="2">institution that knows something about the subject to come and confirm that the container shown </text>
<text top="251" left="57" width="503" height="13" font="2">to him was not made by Plumavit Factory. The police requested the assistance of an expert from </text>
<text top="263" left="57" width="505" height="13" font="2">the Mechanical Engineering Faculty  of the Technical College of the Litoral. They received the </text>
<text top="275" left="57" width="502" height="13" font="2">response from the expert on December 5, 1997 to the effect that the Plumavit Factory of Ecuador </text>
<text top="287" left="57" width="196" height="13" font="2">did not manufacture these containers. </text>
<text top="299" left="57" width="4" height="13" font="2"> </text>

<text top="324" left="57" width="503" height="13" font="2">Chaparro had nothing to do with what they were investigating, criminally hid the results of the </text>
<text top="336" left="57" width="502" height="13" font="2">expert evaluation until December 10, 1997, with the sole purpose of involving him in crimes which </text>
<text top="348" left="57" width="504" height="13" font="2">he did not commit and, then, to take control over his property.  Thereafter, they included the </text>
<text top="360" left="57" width="503" height="13" font="2">evaluation in the file as a loose sheet of paper. In spite of the lack of evidence tying him to the </text>
<text top="372" left="57" width="504" height="13" font="2">charges, as required by Article 333 No. 4 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the judge, in the </text>
<text top="384" left="57" width="505" height="13" font="2">formal initiation of the proceedings charged him with being a “member of an international </text>
<text top="397" left="57" width="503" height="13" font="2">syndicate of drug traffickers”, thereby violating his right to be presumed innocent, as guaranteed </text>
<text top="409" left="57" width="502" height="13" font="2">by the American Convention. The police had illegally searched the Plumavit Factory, owned by the </text>

<text top="433" left="57" width="506" height="13" font="2">remains of drugs were found anywhere.  Subsequently, on the day when the experts from </text>
<text top="445" left="57" width="507" height="13" font="2">E.S.P.O.L. performed their evaluation, police officers and technicians from the US Drug </text>
<text top="457" left="57" width="502" height="13" font="2">Enforcement Administration brought an Ion-Scanner to detect particles of drugs and also found no </text>

<text top="518" left="57" width="502" height="13" font="2">prison, allegedly infringing on his right to defend himself. The police suggested that he could bribe </text>
<text top="530" left="57" width="503" height="13" font="2">them by paying them at least two million <i>sucres</i> to be allowed to wait for the judge. He refused. </text>

<text top="555" left="57" width="502" height="13" font="2">that the seized containers did not fit into the molds used in his Factory. These tests supported the </text>
<text top="567" left="57" width="403" height="13" font="2">earlier findings that his factory could not have produced the containers seized.  </text>

<text top="603" left="57" width="307" height="13" font="2">the internal remedies in the case have not been exhausted.  </text>

<text top="676" left="57" width="502" height="13" font="2">normally. These proceedings have allowed the intervention of specialized experts who have issued </text>

<text top="69" left="57" width="504" height="13" font="2">has noted, the fact that a domestic remedy does not terminate in a favorable ruling for the </text>
<text top="81" left="57" width="503" height="13" font="2">petitioner does not demonstrate, alone, the lack of, or the exhaustion of all efficacious internal </text>

<text top="141" left="57" width="505" height="13" font="2">in the sense that the Inter-American Court has noted in earlier cases, “adequate domestic </text>

<text top="190" left="57" width="503" height="13" font="2">incurred in errors of law, it will grant cassation of the judgment and issue a new one that is in </text>

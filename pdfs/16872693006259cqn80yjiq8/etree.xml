<text top="261" left="85" width="462" height="11" font="0">actions by all parties that might have constituted violations of international human rights law or </text>
<text top="275" left="85" width="444" height="11" font="0">international humanitarian law. The mandate also required it to review related actions in the </text>
<text top="288" left="85" width="234" height="11" font="0">entire Occupied Palestinian Territory and Israel. </text>
<text top="314" left="85" width="471" height="11" font="0">12.  With regard to temporal scope, the Mission decided to focus primarily on events, actions or </text>
<text top="328" left="85" width="418" height="11" font="0">circumstances occurring since 19 June 2008, when a ceasefire was agreed between the </text>
<text top="342" left="85" width="427" height="11" font="0">Government of Israel and Hamas. The Mission has also taken into consideration matters </text>
<text top="356" left="85" width="430" height="11" font="0">occurring after the end of military operations that constitute continuing human rights and </text>
<text top="369" left="85" width="419" height="11" font="0">international humanitarian law violations related to or as a consequence of the military </text>
<text top="383" left="85" width="151" height="11" font="0">operations, up to 31 July 2009. </text>
<text top="409" left="85" width="437" height="11" font="0">13.  The Mission also analysed the historical context of the events that led to the military </text>
<text top="423" left="85" width="468" height="11" font="0">operations in Gaza between 27 December 2008 and 18 January 2009 and the links between these </text>
<text top="437" left="85" width="423" height="11" font="0">operations and overarching Israeli policies vis-à-vis the Occupied Palestinian Territory. </text>
<text top="462" left="85" width="456" height="11" font="0">14.  The Mission considered that the reference in its mandate to violations committed “in the </text>
<text top="476" left="85" width="439" height="11" font="0">context” of the December–January military operations required it to include restrictions on </text>
<text top="490" left="85" width="459" height="11" font="0">human rights and fundamental freedoms relating to Israel's strategies and actions in the context </text>
<text top="504" left="85" width="124" height="11" font="0">of its military operations. </text>
<text top="530" left="85" width="460" height="11" font="0">15.  The normative framework for the Mission has been general international law, the Charter </text>
<text top="543" left="85" width="433" height="11" font="0">of the United Nations, international humanitarian law, international human rights law and </text>
<text top="557" left="85" width="139" height="11" font="0">international criminal law.    </text>

<text top="611" left="85" width="470" height="11" font="0">the Mission considers that the report is illustrative of the main patterns of violations. In Gaza, the </text>
<text top="624" left="85" width="167" height="11" font="0">Mission investigated 36 incidents. </text>
<text top="650" left="85" width="467" height="11" font="0">17.  The Mission based its work on an independent and impartial analysis of compliance by the </text>

<text top="195" left="43" width="442" height="11" font="0">19.  The Mission conducted 188 individual interviews. It reviewed more than 300 reports, </text>

<text top="263" left="43" width="446" height="11" font="0">20.  By refusing to cooperate with the Mission, the Government of Israel prevented it from </text>
<text top="276" left="43" width="451" height="11" font="0">meeting Israeli Government officials, but also from travelling to Israel to meet Israeli victims </text>
<text top="290" left="43" width="446" height="11" font="0">and to the West Bank to meet Palestinian Authority representatives and Palestinian victims.  </text>
<text top="316" left="43" width="458" height="11" font="0">21.  The Mission conducted field visits, including investigations of incident sites, in the Gaza </text>
<text top="330" left="43" width="454" height="11" font="0">Strip. This allowed the Mission to observe first-hand the situation on the ground, and speak to </text>
<text top="344" left="43" width="214" height="11" font="0">many witnesses and other relevant persons.  </text>
<text top="369" left="43" width="442" height="11" font="0">22.  The purpose of the public hearings, which were broadcast live, was to enable victims, </text>
<text top="383" left="43" width="430" height="11" font="0">witnesses and experts from all sides to the conflict to speak directly to as many people as </text>
<text top="397" left="43" width="468" height="11" font="0">possible in the region as well as in the international community. The Mission gave priority to the </text>
<text top="411" left="43" width="451" height="11" font="0">participation of victims and people from the affected communities. The 38 public testimonies </text>
<text top="425" left="43" width="450" height="11" font="0">covered facts as well as legal and military matters. The Mission had initially intended to hold </text>
<text top="438" left="43" width="450" height="11" font="0">hearings in Gaza, Israel and the West Bank. However, denial of access to Israel and the West </text>
<text top="452" left="43" width="457" height="11" font="0">Bank resulted in the decision to hold hearings of participants from Israel and the West Bank in </text>
<text top="466" left="43" width="46" height="11" font="0">Geneva.  </text>
<text top="492" left="43" width="465" height="11" font="0">23.  In establishing its findings, the Mission sought to rely primarily and whenever possible on </text>
<text top="506" left="43" width="461" height="11" font="0">information it gathered first-hand. Information produced by others, including reports, affidavits </text>
<text top="519" left="43" width="277" height="11" font="0">and media reports, was used primarily as corroboration.   </text>
<text top="545" left="43" width="458" height="11" font="0">24.  The Mission’s final conclusions on the reliability of the information received were based </text>
<text top="559" left="43" width="440" height="11" font="0">on its own assessment of the credibility and reliability of the witnesses it met, verifying the </text>
<text top="573" left="43" width="437" height="11" font="0">sources and the methodology used in the reports and documents produced by others, cross-</text>
<text top="587" left="43" width="400" height="11" font="0">referencing the relevant material and information, and assessing whether, in all the </text>
<text top="600" left="43" width="458" height="11" font="0">circumstances, there was sufficient credible and reliable information for the Mission to make a </text>
<text top="614" left="43" width="80" height="11" font="0">finding in fact.   </text>
<text top="640" left="43" width="454" height="11" font="0">25.  On this basis, the Mission has, to the best of its ability, determined what facts have been </text>
<text top="654" left="43" width="466" height="11" font="0">established. In many cases it has found that acts entailing individual criminal responsibility have </text>
<text top="668" left="43" width="469" height="11" font="0">been committed. In all of these cases the Mission has found that there is sufficient information to </text>

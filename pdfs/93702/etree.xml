<text top="182" left="57" width="503" height="13" font="2">accusing the Argentine Republic (hereinafter “Argentina” or “the State”) of allegedly violating the </text>
<text top="194" left="57" width="506" height="13" font="2">following rights enshrined in the American Convention on Human Rights (hereinafter “the </text>

<text top="244" left="57" width="502" height="13" font="2">2.  The petitioner describes a series of events to the Commission, chiefly involving the alleged </text>
<text top="256" left="57" width="503" height="13" font="2">arbitrary arrest and torture carried out against him by officers of the “<i>Divisi de Defraudaciones y </i></text>
<text top="268" left="57" width="503" height="13" font="3"><i>Estafas</i>.” These incidents allegedly took place on April 5 and 6, 1988, respectively. In reply, the </text>
<text top="281" left="57" width="502" height="13" font="2">State maintains that the remedies available under domestic law have not been exhausted and that </text>
<text top="293" left="57" width="422" height="13" font="2">consequently, under Article 46(1)(a) of the Convention, the case is not admissible. </text>
<text top="319" left="57" width="503" height="13" font="2">3. The Commission concludes that the petitioner has not exhausted the remedies offered under </text>
<text top="331" left="57" width="502" height="13" font="2">domestic law in connection with the alleged threats made against him by the police. This aspect of </text>
<text top="343" left="57" width="503" height="13" font="2">the case is therefore inadmissible under Article 46(1)(a) of the Convention and Article 37 of the </text>

<text top="368" left="57" width="502" height="13" font="2">not constitute a violation of rights enshrined in the Convention, as required by Article 47(b) of the </text>
<text top="380" left="57" width="503" height="13" font="2">Convention and Article 41(b) of the aforesaid Regulations. On the contrary, in the Commission’s </text>
<text top="392" left="57" width="503" height="13" font="2">view those allegations are manifestly groundless, as described in Article 47(c) of the Convention </text>
<text top="404" left="57" width="186" height="13" font="2">and Article 41(c) of the Regulations. </text>
<text top="430" left="57" width="503" height="13" font="2">4 The Commission also concludes that the petitioner’s allegations of torture, the denial of a fair </text>
<text top="442" left="57" width="503" height="13" font="2">trial, and ineffective judicial recourse do meet the admissibility requirements set forth in Article </text>

<text top="450" left="57" width="502" height="13" font="2">15.  The petitioner initiated a real-estate sales transaction with Norma Lage and Jorge Denegri, </text>
<text top="462" left="57" width="504" height="13" font="2">which was not finalized. He filed a complaint against the two of them for fraud and threats in </text>
<text top="474" left="57" width="503" height="13" font="2">January 1988. In turn, on February 22, Norma Lage filed a complaint against the petitioner and </text>
<text top="486" left="57" width="503" height="13" font="2">another individual, alleging fraud and extortion, with which criminal proceedings N 24519 began. </text>
<text top="498" left="57" width="503" height="13" font="2">The petitioner states that on the following March 20, he and the other parties to the transaction </text>
<text top="510" left="57" width="505" height="13" font="2">agreed to cancel the transaction. However, on April 5, the petitioner and his attorney were </text>
<text top="523" left="57" width="504" height="13" font="2">arrested, the attorney’s professional office was searched, and the recording of the cancellation </text>
<text top="535" left="57" width="503" height="13" font="2">meeting was seized. This series of actions was carried out by officers of the Fraud Division of the </text>
<text top="547" left="57" width="501" height="13" font="2">Argentine Federal Police, acting on a court order issued as a part of criminal proceedings N 24519. </text>
<text top="573" left="57" width="503" height="13" font="2">16. He claims he was tortured at the facilities of the police on April 6, 1988, to coerce him into </text>

<text top="683" left="57" width="474" height="11" font="4">1 The petitioner argues that the alleged animosity of the police was because his attorney, Carlos A. Pez Galindo, had </text>

<text top="610" left="57" width="505" height="13" font="2">claims that the torture he suffered resulted in “perforation of the eardrum caused by direct </text>

<text top="95" left="57" width="503" height="13" font="2">18. Because of the torture inflicted on the petitioner, proceedings N 24079, “for maltreatment,” </text>
<text top="107" left="57" width="492" height="13" font="2">were initiated. The petitioner claims these proceedings were plagued with irregularities, such as: </text>

<text top="295" left="57" width="504" height="13" font="2">60.    It should be noted that the petitioner has also claimed that during his arrest, his police </text>
<text top="307" left="57" width="502" height="13" font="2">guards “punched him in the stomach” but that “no evidence was given [...] of the results of such </text>

<text top="382" left="57" width="502" height="13" font="2">RenJes Derecho, Horacio Soto, and Norberto Cdido Ruiz. The judge issued an order for them to be </text>
<text top="394" left="57" width="503" height="13" font="2">placed in preventive custody, which was not carried out, and this was addressed by the ruling of </text>
<text top="406" left="57" width="357" height="13" font="2">February 21, 1995, in proceedings N 32989 brought by the petitioner. </text>

<text top="456" left="57" width="506" height="13" font="2">police building. These proceedings also analyzed the petitioner’s claims about the alleged </text>

<text top="480" left="57" width="312" height="13" font="2">maintains, contained evidence of the torture inflicted on him. </text>
<text top="507" left="57" width="505" height="13" font="2">63.  The Commission notes that it is not clear that proceedings N 24079 addressed all the </text>
<text top="519" left="57" width="502" height="13" font="2">petitioner’s torture allegations, since the ruling in the case solely refers to the violence carried out </text>
<text top="531" left="57" width="503" height="13" font="2">against the petitioner’s ears and hearing apparatus. In other words, the ruling makes no mention </text>
<text top="543" left="57" width="504" height="13" font="2">of the alleged blows to the stomach or to the deliberate denial of the medication needed to </text>
<text top="555" left="57" width="298" height="13" font="2">combat the ulcer pains from which the petitioner suffered. </text>
<text top="582" left="57" width="504" height="13" font="2">64.  The Commission also notes that the State’s replies to the Commission have not specifically </text>
<text top="594" left="57" width="265" height="13" font="2">addressed these allegations made by the petitioner. </text>
<text top="620" left="57" width="503" height="13" font="2">65.  The Commission concludes that, if these allegations are proven true, this aspect of the case </text>

<text top="93" left="57" width="502" height="13" font="2">Court N 39, Secretariat N 135, was intended to subject all the alleged irregularities in proceedings </text>
<text top="105" left="57" width="503" height="13" font="2">N 24079 to judicial scrutiny. That was the remedy available to the petitioner under Argentine law </text>

<text top="284" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">4. To appreciate the thrust of the above questions and the answers to them, it is necessary first to</text>
<text top="299" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">have a proper understanding of what 'telecasting' means and what its legal dimensions and</text>
<text top="315" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">consequences are. Telecasting is a system of communication either audio or visual or both. We are</text>
<text top="330" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">concerned in the present case with audio-visual telecommunication. The first stage in telecasting is</text>
<text top="346" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">to generate the audio-visual signals of the events or of the information which is sought to be</text>
<text top="361" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">communicated. When the event to be telecast takes place on the earth, necessarily the signal is</text>
<text top="376" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">generated on the earth by the requisite electronic mechanism such as the audio-visual recorder. This</text>
<text top="392" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">stage may be described as the recording stage. The events may be spontaneous, accidental, natural</text>
<text top="407" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">or organised. The spontaneous, accidental and natural events are by their nature uncontrollable. But</text>
<text top="423" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">the organised events can be controlled by the law of the land. In our country, since the Organisation</text>
<text top="438" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">of an event is an aspect of the fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression protected by</text>
<text top="453" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">Article 19 [1] (a), the law can be made to control the Organisation of such events only for the</text>
<text top="469" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">purposes of imposing reasonable restrictions in the interest of the sovereignty and integrity of the</text>
<text top="484" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">country, the security of the state, friendly relations with foreign States, public order, decency or</text>
<text top="500" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">morality or in relation to contempt of court, defamation or incitement- to an offence as laid down</text>
<text top="515" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">under Article 19 [2] of the Constitution. Al- though, therefore, it is not possible to make law for</text>
<text top="530" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">prohibiting the recording of spontaneous, accidental or natural events, it is possible for the reasons</text>
<text top="546" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">mentioned in Article 19 [2], to restrict their telecasting. As regards the organised events, a law can</text>
<text top="561" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">be made for restricting or prohibiting the Organisation of the event itself, and also for telecasting it,</text>
<text top="577" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">on the same grounds as are mentioned in Article 19 [2]. There, cannot, however, be restrictions on</text>
<text top="592" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">producing and recording the event on grounds not permitted by Article 19 [2]. It, therefore, follows</text>
<text top="607" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">that the Organisation or production of an event and its recording cannot be prevented except by law</text>
<text top="623" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">permitted by Article 19 [2]. For the same reasons, the publication or communication of the recorded</text>
<text top="638" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">event through the mode of cassettes cannot be restricted or prevented except under such law. All</text>
<text top="654" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">those who have got the apparatus of video cassette recorder [VCR] and the television screen can,</text>
<text top="669" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">therefore, view and listen to such recorded event [hereinafter referred to, for the sake of</text>
<text top="684" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">convenience, as 'viewers']. In this process, there is no demand on any frequency or channel since</text>
<text top="700" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">there is no live- telecast of the event. The only additional restriction on telecasting or live-telecasting</text>
<text top="715" left="72" width="345" height="12" font="0">of such event will be the lack of availability of the frequency or channel.</text>

<text top="53" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">5. Since in the present case, what is involved is the right to live-telecast the event, viz., the cricket</text>
<text top="68" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">matches organised by the Cricket Association of Bengal, it is necessary to understand the various</text>
<text top="84" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">issues involved in live telecasting. It may be made clear at the outset, that there may as well be a file</text>
<text top="99" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">telecast [i.e., telecasting of the events which are already recorded by the cassette]. The issues</text>
<text top="115" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">involved in file telecasting will also be more or less the same and therefore, that subject is not dealt</text>
<text top="130" left="72" width="457" height="12" font="0">with separately. Telecasting live or file necessarily involves the use of a frequency or a channel.</text>
<text top="161" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">6. The telecasting is of three types, [a] terrestrial, [b] cable and [c] satellite. In the first case, the</text>
<text top="176" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">signal is generated by the camera stationed at the spot of the event,- and the signal is then sent to</text>
<text top="192" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">the earthly telecasting station such as the T.V. Centre which in turn relays it through its own</text>
<text top="207" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">frequencies to all the viewers who have T.V.screens/sets. In the second case, viz., cable telecasting,</text>
<text top="222" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">the cable operator receives the signals from the satellite by means of the parabolic dish antenna and</text>
<text top="238" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">relays them to all those T.V. screens which are linked to his cable. He also relays the recorded file</text>
<text top="253" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">programmes or cassettes through the cable to the cable-linked viewers. In this case, there is no</text>
<text top="269" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">restriction on his receiving the signals from any satellite to which his antenna is adjusted. There is</text>
<text top="284" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">no demand made by him on any frequency or channel owned or controlled by the national</text>
<text top="299" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">government or governmental agencies. The cable operator can show any event occurring in any part</text>
<text top="315" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">of the country or the world live through the frequencies if his dish antenna can receive the same. The</text>
<text top="330" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">only limitation from which the cable T.V. suffers is that the programmes relayed by it can be</text>
<text top="346" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">received only by those viewers who are linked to the dish antenna concerned. The last type, viz.,</text>
<text top="361" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">satellite T.V. operation involves the use of a frequency generated, owned or controlled by the</text>
<text top="376" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">national Government or the Governmental agencies, or those generated, owned and controlled by</text>
<text top="392" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">other agencies. It is necessary to bear in mind the distinction between the frequencies generated,</text>
<text top="407" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">owned and controlled by the Government or Governmental agency and those generated and owned</text>
<text top="423" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">by the other agencies. This is so because generally, as in the present case, one of the contentions</text>
<text top="438" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">against the right to access to telecasting is that there are a limited number of frequencies and hence</text>
<text top="453" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">there is the need to utilise the limited resources for the benefit of all sections of the society and to</text>
<text top="469" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">promote all social interests by giving them priority as determined by some central authority. It</text>
<text top="484" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">follows, therefore, that where the resources are unlimited or the right to telecast need not suffer for</text>
<text top="500" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">want of a frequency, objection on the said ground would be misplaced. It may be stated here that in</text>
<text top="515" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">the present case, the contention of the MIB and DD against the right to telecast claimed by the</text>
<text top="530" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">Cricket Association of Bengal [CAB]/Board of Control for Cricket in India [BCCI] was raised only on</text>
<text top="546" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">the ground of the limitation of frequencies, ignoring the fact that the CAB/BCCI had not made</text>
<text top="561" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">demand on any of the frequencies generated or owned by the MIB/DD. It desired to telecast the</text>
<text top="577" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">cricket matches organised by it through a frequency not owned or controlled by the Government but</text>
<text top="592" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">owned by some other agency. The only permission that the CAB/ BCCI sought was to uplink to the</text>
<text top="607" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">foreign satellite the signals created by its own cameras and the earth station or the cameras and the</text>
<text top="623" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">earth station of its agency to a foreign satellite. This permission was sought by the CAB/BCCI from</text>
<text top="638" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">VSNL which is the Government agency controlling the frequencies. The permission again cannot be</text>
<text top="654" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">refused except under law made in pursuance of the provisions of Article 19 [2] of the Constitution.</text>
<text top="669" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">Hence, as stated above, one of the important questions to be answered in the present case is whether</text>
<text top="684" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">the permission to uplink to the foreign satellite, the signal created by the CAB/BCCI either by itself</text>
<text top="700" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">or through its agency can be refused except on the ground stated in the law made under Article 19</text>

<text top="99" left="72" width="187" height="12" font="0">dimensions of the right are delineated.</text>

<text top="207" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">pose of securing the public safety and the maintenance of public order. The petitioner approached</text>
<text top="222" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">this Court under Article 32 of the Constitution claiming that the order contravened the petitioner's</text>
<text top="238" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression. He also challenged the validity of Section 9</text>
<text top="253" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">[1-A] of the impugned Act. The majority of the Court held that the freedom of speech and expression</text>
<text top="269" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">includes freedom of propagation of ideas and that freedom is ensured by the freedom of circulation.</text>
<text top="284" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">In support of this view, the Court referred to two decisions of the U.S. Su- preme Court viz., [1]</text>

<text top="330" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">the liberty of publication. Indeed, without circulation the publication would be of little value&#34;.</text>
<text top="346" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">Section 9 [1-A] of the impugned Act authorised the Provincial Government, &#34;for the purpose of</text>
<text top="361" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">securing the public safety or the maintenance of public order, to prohibit or regulate the entry into</text>

<text top="392" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">or class of documents&#34;. The question that the Court had to answer was whether the impugned Act</text>
<text top="407" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">insofar as it contained the aforesaid provision was a law relating to a matter which undermined the</text>
<text top="423" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">security of, or tended to overthrow the State. The Court held that &#34;public order&#34; is an expression of</text>
<text top="438" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">wide connotation and signifies that state of tranquility which prevails among the members of a</text>

<text top="469" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">established. The Act was passed by the Provincial Leg- islature under Section 100 of the</text>

<text top="253" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">(a) included the freedom of the press. For propagating his ideas a citizen had the right to publish</text>
<text top="269" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">them, to disseminate them and to circulate them, either by word or mouth or by writing. The right</text>
<text top="284" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">extended not merely to the matter which he was entitled to circulate but also to the volume of</text>
<text top="299" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">circulation. Although the impugned Act and the Order placed restraints on the volume of</text>
<text top="315" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">circulation, their very object was directed against circulation. Thus both interfered with the freedom</text>
<text top="330" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">of speech and expression. The Court held that Article 19 [2] did not permit the State to abridge the</text>
<text top="346" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">said right in the interest of general public. The Court also held that the State could not make a law</text>
<text top="361" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">which directly restricted one guaranteed freedom for securing the better enjoyment of another</text>
<text top="376" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">freedom. Freedom of speech could not be restricted for the purpose of regu- lating the commercial</text>
<text top="392" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">aspect of the activities of newspapers. In this connection, the following observations of the Court are</text>
<text top="407" left="72" width="43" height="12" font="0">relevant:</text>
<text top="438" left="108" width="415" height="12" font="0">&#34;Its object thus is to regulate something which, as already stated, is directly related to</text>
<text top="453" left="108" width="415" height="12" font="0">the circulation of a newspaper. Since circulation of a newspaper is a part of the right</text>
<text top="469" left="108" width="415" height="12" font="0">of freedom of speech the Act must be regarded as one directed against the freedom of</text>
<text top="484" left="108" width="415" height="12" font="0">speech. It has selected the fact or thing which is an essential and basic attribute of the</text>
<text top="500" left="108" width="415" height="12" font="0">conception of the freedom of speech, viz., the right to circulate one's views to all</text>
<text top="515" left="108" width="415" height="12" font="0">whom one can reach or care to reach for the imposition of a restriction. It seeks to</text>
<text top="530" left="108" width="415" height="12" font="0">achieve its object of enabling what are termed the smaller newspapers to secure</text>
<text top="546" left="108" width="415" height="12" font="0">larger cir- culation by provisions which without disguise are aimed at restricting the</text>
<text top="561" left="108" width="415" height="12" font="0">circulation of what are termed the larger papers with better financial strength. The</text>
<text top="577" left="108" width="415" height="12" font="0">impugned law far from being one, which merely interferes with the right of freedom</text>
<text top="592" left="108" width="415" height="12" font="0">of speech incidentally, does so directly though it seeks to achieve the end by</text>
<text top="607" left="108" width="415" height="12" font="0">purporting to regulate the business aspect of a newspaper. Such a course is not</text>
<text top="623" left="108" width="415" height="12" font="0">permissible and the courts must be ever vigilant in guarding perhaps the most</text>

<text top="253" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">(a). This expression means a freedom from interference from authority which would have the effect</text>
<text top="269" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">of interference with the content and circulation of newspapers. There cannot be any interference</text>
<text top="284" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">with that freedom in the name of public interest. The purpose of the press is to advance the public</text>
<text top="299" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">interest by publishing facts and opinions without which democratic electorate cannot make</text>
<text top="315" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">responsible judgments. Freedom of the press is the heart of social and political intercourse. It is the</text>
<text top="330" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">primary duty of the Courts to up- ,,hold the freedom of the press and invalidate all laws or</text>
<text top="346" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">administrative actions which interfere with it contrary to the constitutional mandate. The freedom</text>
<text top="361" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">of expression has four broad social purposes to serve: [i] it helps an individual to attain self</text>
<text top="376" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">fulfilment, [ii] it assists in the discovery of truth, [iii] it strengthens the capacity of an individual in</text>

<text top="407" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">establish a reasonable balance between stability and social change. All members of the society</text>
<text top="423" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">should be able to form their own beliefs and communicate them freely to others. In sum, the</text>
<text top="438" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">fundamental principle involved here is the people's right to know. Freedom of speech and</text>
<text top="453" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">expression should, therefore, receive a generous support from all those who believe in the</text>
<text top="469" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">participation of people in the administration. It is on account of this special interest which society</text>
<text top="484" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">has in the freedom of speech and expression that the approach of the Government should be more</text>

<text top="577" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">restrictions imposed on any fundamental right the Court should take into consideration the nature</text>
<text top="592" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">of the right alleged to have been infringed, the underlying purpose of the restrictions imposed, the</text>
<text top="607" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">disproportion of the imposition and the prevailing conditions including the social values whose</text>

<text top="638" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">duty on news print is an imposition of tax on knowledge and would virtually amount to a burden</text>

<text top="68" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">it was held that the right of citizens to exhibit films on Doordarshan subject to the terms and</text>
<text top="84" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">conditions to be imposed by the Doordarshan is a part of the fundamental right of freedom of</text>
<text top="99" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">expression guaranteed under Article 19 [1] (a) which can be curtailed only under circumstances set</text>
<text top="115" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">out under Article 19 [2]. The right is similar to the right of citizen to public his views through any</text>

<text top="161" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">always very zealously guarded by the Supreme Court. However, on the question whether a citizen</text>
<text top="176" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">has a fundamental right to estab- lish a private broadcasting station or T.V. centre, the Court</text>
<text top="192" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">reserved its opinion for decision in an appropriate case. The matter had come up before this Court</text>
<text top="207" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">against an interim injunction order issued by the High Court as a result of which 12th and 13th</text>
<text top="222" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">episodes of the film &#34;Honi- Anhoni&#34; could not be telecast on the scheduled dates. The Court held</text>
<text top="238" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">that it was not the case of the writ petitioners before the High Court that the exhibition of the said</text>
<text top="253" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">serial was in contravention of any specific law or direction issued by the Government. They had also</text>
<text top="269" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">not alleged that the Doordarshan had shown any undue favour to the appellant and the sponsoring</text>
<text top="284" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">institutions resulting in any financial loss to the public exchequer. The objection to the exhibition of</text>
<text top="299" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">the film had been raised by them on the basis that it was likely to spread false or blind beliefs among</text>

<text top="361" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">prejudicially the wellbeing of the people. The Union of India and Doordarshan had pleaded that the</text>
<text top="376" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">serial was being telecast after following the prescribed procedure and taking necessary precautions.</text>
<text top="392" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">The writ petitioners had not produced any material. apart from their own statements to show&#34; that</text>
<text top="407" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">the exhibition of the serial was prima facie prejudicial to the community. This Court held that the</text>
<text top="423" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">High Court had overlooked that the issue of an order of interim injunction would infringe the</text>
<text top="438" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">fundamental right of the producer of a serial. In the absence of any prima facie evidence of gross</text>
<text top="453" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">prejudice that was likely to be caused to the public generally by the exhibition of the serial, it was not</text>

<text top="145" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">other modes of communication. Movie motivates thought and action and assures a high degree of</text>
<text top="161" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">attention and retention. In view of the scientific improve- ments in photography and production, the</text>
<text top="176" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">present movie is a powerful means of communication. It has a unique capacity to disturb and arouse</text>
<text top="192" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">feelings. It has much potential for evil as it has for good. With these qualities and since it caters for</text>
<text top="207" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">mass audience who are generally not selective about what they watch, the movie cannot be equated</text>
<text top="222" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">with other modes of communication. It cannot be allowed to function in a free marketplace just as</text>
<text top="238" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">does the newspaper or magazines. Censorship by prior restraint is, therefore, not only desirable but</text>
<text top="253" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">also necessary. But the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution does not permit any prior</text>
<text top="269" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">restraint, since the guarantee of free speech is in unqualified terms. Censorship is permitted mainly</text>
<text top="284" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">on the ground of social interests specified under Article 19 [2] with emphasis on maintenance of</text>
<text top="299" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">values and standards of society. Therefore, censorship with prior restraint must necessarily be</text>
<text top="315" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">reasonable that could be saved by the well accepted principles of judicial review. The standard to be</text>
<text top="330" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">applied by the board or courts for judging the film should be that of an ordinary man of common</text>
<text top="346" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">sense and prudence and not that of an out of the ordinary or hypersensitive man. The board should</text>
<text top="361" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">exercise considerable circumspection on movies affecting the morality or decency of our people and</text>
<text top="376" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">cultural heritage of the country. The moral values in particular, should not be allowed to be</text>
<text top="392" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">sacrificed in the guise of social change or cultural assimilation. The path of right conduct shown by</text>
<text top="407" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">the great sages and thinkers of India and the concept of 'Dharam' [righteousness in every respect],</text>
<text top="423" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">which are the bedrock of our civilisation, should not be allowed to be shaken by unethical standards.</text>
<text top="438" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">But this does not mean that the censors should have an orthodox or conservative outlook. Far from</text>
<text top="453" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">it, they must be responsive to social change and they must go with the current climate. However, the</text>
<text top="469" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">censors may display more sensitivity to movies which will have a markedly deleterious effect to</text>
<text top="484" left="72" width="222" height="12" font="0">lower the moral standards of those who see it.</text>

<text top="577" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">opinion on any issue of general concern. He can form and inform by any legitimate means. The</text>
<text top="592" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">democracy is a government by the people via open discussion. The democratic form of government</text>
<text top="607" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">itself demands its citizens an active and intelligent participation in the affairs of the community. The</text>

<text top="53" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">LIC wrote a counter article and published it in the daily newspaper &#34;Hindu&#34;. The respondent replied</text>

<text top="99" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">magazine. That request was turned down. On these facts, the re- spondent filed a writ petition</text>
<text top="115" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">before the High Court challenging the action of the LIC, among other things, on the ground that his</text>
<text top="130" left="72" width="184" height="12" font="0">fundamental right under Article 19 [1]</text>
<text top="161" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">(a) of the Constitution was violate by LIC by refusing to publish his reply. The High Court held that</text>
<text top="176" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">under the pre- text and guise of publishing a house magazine, the LIC cannot violate the</text>
<text top="192" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">fundamental rights of the petitioner. This Court endorsing the view taken by the High Court held</text>
<text top="207" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">that the LIC is 'State' within the meaning of Article 12. The LIC Act requires it to function in the best</text>
<text top="222" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">interest of the community. The community is, therefore, entitled to know whether or not this</text>
<text top="238" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">requirement of the statute is being satisfied in the functioning of the LIC. The respondent's efforts in</text>
<text top="253" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">preparing the study paper was to bring to the notice of the community that the LIC had strayed from</text>
<text top="269" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">its path by pointing out that its premium rates were unduly high when they could be low if the LIC</text>
<text top="284" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">avoided the wasteful indulgences. The endeavour was to enlighten the community of the drawbacks</text>
<text top="299" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">and shortcomings of the LIC and to pinpoint the area where improvement was needed and was</text>
<text top="315" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">possible. By denying to the policy-holders, the information contained in the rejoinder prepared by</text>
<text top="330" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">the respondent, the LIC cannot be said to be acting in the best interest of the community. There was</text>
<text top="346" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">nothing offensive in the rejoinder which fell within the restriction clauses of Article 19 [2]. Nor was</text>
<text top="361" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">it prejudicial to the members of the community or based on imaginary or concocted material. On the</text>
<text top="376" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">basis of the fairness doctrine the LIC was under an obligation to publish the rejoinder. The</text>
<text top="392" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">respondent's fun- damental right to speech and expression clearly entitled him to insist that his</text>
<text top="407" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">views on the subject should reach those who read the magazine so that they have complete picture</text>
<text top="423" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">before them instead of a one-side or distorted picture The Court also pointed out that the attitude of</text>
<text top="438" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">the LIC in refusing to publish the rejoinder in their magazine financed from public funds, can be</text>
<text top="453" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">described as both unfair and unreasonable unfair because fairness demanded that both view-points</text>
<text top="469" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">were placed before the readers and unreasonable because there was no justification for refusing</text>
<text top="484" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">publication. The monopolistic State instrumentality which survives on public funds cannot act in an</text>
<text top="500" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">arbitrary manner on the specious plea that the magazine is an in-house one and it is a matter of its</text>
<text top="515" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">exclusive privilege to print or refuse to print the rejoinder. By refusing to print and publish the</text>
<text top="530" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">rejoinder', the LIC had violated respondent's fundamental right. The Court must be careful to see</text>
<text top="546" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">that it does not even unwittingly' aid the effort to defeat the parties' right. Every free citizen has an</text>
<text top="561" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">undoubted right to lay what sentiments he pleases before the public. Freedom to air one's views is</text>
<text top="577" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">the lifeline of any democratic institution and any attempt to stifle, suffocate or gag this right would</text>
<text top="592" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">sound a death-knell to democracy and would help usher in autocracy or dictatorship. This Court has</text>
<text top="607" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">always placed a broad interpretation on the value and content of Article 19 [1] (a), making it subject</text>
<text top="623" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">only to the restrictions permissible under Article 19 [2]. Efforts by intolerant authorities to curb or</text>
<text top="638" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">suffocate this freedom have always been firmly repelled, more so when public authorities have</text>
<text top="654" left="72" width="325" height="12" font="0">betrayed autocratic tendencies. The Court then went on to observe:</text>
<text top="684" left="108" width="415" height="12" font="0">broadly construed to include the freedom to circulate one's views by words of mouth</text>
<text top="700" left="108" width="415" height="12" font="0">or in writing or through audio-visual instrumentalities. It, therefore, includes the</text>

<text top="53" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">prior restraints, regardless of their form, are frowned upon as threats to freedom of expression since</text>
<text top="68" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">they contain within themselves forces which if released have the potential of imposing arbitrary-</text>
<text top="84" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">and at times direct conflict with the right of another citizen. Censorship by prior restraint, therefore,</text>
<text top="99" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">seems justified for the protec- tion of the society from the ill-effects that a motion picture may</text>
<text top="115" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">produce if unrestricted exhibition is allowed. Censorship is thus permitted to protect social interests</text>
<text top="130" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">enumerated in Article 19 [2] and Section 5-B of the Cinema to graph Act. For this reason, need for</text>
<text top="145" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">prior restraint has been recognised and our laws have assigned a specific role to the censors, as such</text>
<text top="161" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">is the need in a rapidly changing societal structure. But since permissible restrictions, albeit</text>
<text top="176" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">reasonable, are all the same restrictions, they are bound to be viewed as anathema, in that, they are</text>
<text top="192" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">in the nature of curbs or limitations on the exercise of the right and are, therefore, bound to be</text>

<text top="222" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">to show that the restrictions are reasonable and permissible in law. Such censorship must be</text>

<text top="530" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">of freedom of expression are stated in the following words. The liberty to express one's self freely is</text>
<text top="546" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">important for a number of reasons. Firstly, self-expression is a signifi- cant instrument of freedom of</text>
<text top="561" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">conscience and self- fulfillment. Second justification concerns epistemology. Freedom of expression</text>
<text top="577" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">enables people to contribute to debates about social and moral values. The best way to find the best</text>
<text top="592" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">or truest theory or model of anything is to permit the widest possible range of ideas to circulate.</text>
<text top="607" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">Thirdly, the freedom of expression allows political discourse which is necessary in any country</text>
<text top="623" left="72" width="448" height="12" font="0">which aspires to democracy. And lastly, it facilitates artistic scholarly endeavours of all sorts.</text>
<text top="654" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">35. The obvious connection between press freedom and freedom of speech is that the press is a</text>
<text top="669" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">medium for broadcasting information and opinion. Firstly, media freedom as a tool of</text>
<text top="684" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">self-expression is a significant instrument of personal autonomy. Secondly, as a channel of</text>
<text top="700" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">communication, it helps to allow the political discourse in a democracy. Thirdly, it helps to provide</text>

<text top="99" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">36.Referring to the reasons for regulating the broadcasting media, the learned author has stated</text>
<text top="115" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">that, first, the Government realises the potential of channels of mass communication for</text>
<text top="130" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">contributing to democracy or undermining it. They hoped to foster a public service ethos in</text>
<text top="145" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">broadcastings so that it would be a medium for educating and improving the population. Secondly</text>
<text top="161" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">in order to do this its was necessary to keep the media of mass communications from having</text>
<text top="176" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">programme policy dictated entirely by market forces. A strong pubic sector and regulation of the</text>
<text top="192" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">inde- pendent sector when one started to operate, were called for. Thirdly, when commercial</text>
<text top="207" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">broadcasters appeared on the scene, 1 and a regulatory scheme was being developed for them, it was</text>
<text top="222" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">thought to be important to preserve a diversity of ideas by preventing oligopolistic concentrations of</text>
<text top="238" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">power in the hands of a few, usually rich and conservative media magnates, and to ensure that</text>
<text top="253" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">licences were granted only to people who could be expected not to abuse the privilege. The need to</text>
<text top="269" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">preserve propriety has been a motivating factor in the regulation of commercial broadcasting over</text>
<text top="284" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">much of the world. Fourthly, government hoped to ensure that civilised standards were maintained,</text>
<text top="299" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">to uphold social values. Fifthly, wave lengths for broadcasting were limited. This purely technical</text>
<text top="315" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">consideration sharply distinguishes broadcasting from newspapers, and justifies a higher level of</text>
<text top="330" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">regulation. In theory, if not in practice, there is nothing to prevent any number of newspapers being</text>
<text top="346" left="72" width="23" height="12" font="0">pub-</text>
<text top="376" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">lished simultaneously. The only controlling mechanism needed is that of market forces. This is not</text>
<text top="392" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">true of broadcasting. Some control over the allocation of wave- lengths is 'needed in order to ensure</text>
<text top="407" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">that there are sufficient for all legitimate broadcasters. Lastly, another legitimate object of national</text>
<text top="423" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">regulation is to protect the intellectual property rights of programme makers and broadcasters. It is</text>
<text top="438" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">permissible on this ground for an Organisation to prevent people from getting access to</text>
<text top="453" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">programmes without paying proper licence fees. One way of preventing this is to encode programme</text>
<text top="469" left="72" width="359" height="12" font="0">transmissions and to restrict access to decoders to people who pay the fee.</text>
<text top="500" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">37. The freedom to receive and to communicate information and ideas without interference is an</text>

<text top="145" left="72" width="310" height="12" font="0">so, whether it necessitates more restrictions on the latter media.</text>
<text top="176" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">39. Eric Barendt in his book titled &#34; Broadcasting Law [1993 Edn.] which presents a comparative</text>
<text top="192" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">study of the law in five' legal systems, viz., Great Britain, France, Germany, Italy and United States</text>
<text top="207" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">of America, has dealt with the subject succinctly. He has referred to a number of reasons which are</text>
<text top="222" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">generally put forward to justify broadcasting regulations and has dealt with each of them. The first</text>
<text top="238" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">reason advanced is that because the airwaves are a public resource, the Government or some agency</text>
<text top="253" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">on its behalf, is entitled to license their use for broadcasting on the terms it sees fit. A similar</text>
<text top="269" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">argument can now be deployed in respect of cable broadcasting where an authority must give</text>
<text top="284" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">permission before roads can be dug up for laying cable. The learned author states that the case is</text>
<text top="299" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">unconvincing for it infers that it is right for the Government to regulate broadcasting from the fact</text>
<text top="315" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">that it has opportunity to do this. It would be perfectly possible for Government to allocate</text>
<text top="330" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">frequencies for cable franchises without programme conditions on the basis of a competitive tender</text>
<text top="346" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">and allow the resale by the purchaser. The argument, according to the author, therefore, does not</text>
<text top="361" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">work. It does not justify broadcasting regulations but almost explains how it is feasible. The author,</text>
<text top="376" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">however, does not accept the objection to this reason for regulation that thereby Government acts</text>
<text top="392" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">improperly by using their licensing power to purchase broadcasters' constitutional right to speech.</text>
<text top="407" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">According to the author, this argument is less persuasive as it assumes that broadcasters enjoy the</text>
<text top="423" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">same constitutional rights of free speech as individuals talking in a bar or leafletting in a high street.</text>
<text top="438" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">The author then deals with the second reason given for regulation of broadcasting, viz., scarcity of</text>
<text top="453" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">frequencies and points out that this argument referred to in Red Lion Broadcasting case [supra] is</text>
<text top="469" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">less clear than ap- pears at first sight, since it is not clear whether the scarcity of frequencies refers</text>
<text top="484" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">to the limited number allocated by the Government as available for broadcasting or to the actual</text>
<text top="500" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">numerical shortage of broadcasting stations. If it is the former, the scarcity is an artificial creation of</text>
<text top="515" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">the Government rather than a natural phenomenon since it reserves a number of frequencies for the</text>
<text top="530" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">use of the army, police and other public services. The Government is then not in a good position to</text>
<text top="546" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">argue for restrictions on broadcasters' freedom. The author then points out that as far as the actual</text>
<text top="561" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">scarcity of broadcasting stations is concerned, there has been an increase in the last 20 years in the</text>
<text top="577" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">broadcasting stations in the United States while there are fewer newspapers than there used to be.</text>
<text top="592" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">Similar developments have occurred in European countries in the same period, especially, since the</text>
<text top="607" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">advent of cable and satellite. Further the scarcity argument cannot be divorced from economic</text>
<text top="623" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">considerations. The shortage of frequencies and the high cost of starting up broadcasting channel</text>
<text top="638" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">explain their dearth in comparison with the number of newspapers and magazines in 1961.</text>
<text top="654" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">However, it is now probably as difficult to finance a new newspaper as it is a private television</text>
<text top="669" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">channel, if not more so. Lastly, the author points out that the scarcity argument is much less tenable</text>
<text top="684" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">than it used to be. Cable and satellite have significantly increased the number of available or</text>
<text top="700" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">potentially available channels so that there are more broadcasting outlets than there are national or</text>
<text top="715" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">local daily newspapers. Dealing with the third reason advocated for giving differential treatment to</text>

<text top="68" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">that television and radio, are more influential on public opinion than the press, or at least are widely</text>
<text top="84" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">thought to be so. The majority of the US Supreme Court in FCC v. Pacifica Foundation [438 US 726]</text>
<text top="99" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">said that they intrude into the home and are more pervasive and are more difficult to control than</text>
<text top="115" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">the print media. In particular, it is hard to prevent children from being exposed to broadcast while it</text>
<text top="130" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">is relatively easy to stop them looking at magazines and papers which in any case they will not be</text>
<text top="145" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">able to read or purchase. These grounds underpin the extension of legal control in Britain over</text>

<text top="207" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">has held that regulation is necessary to guarantee pluralism and programme variety, whether or not</text>
<text top="222" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">there is a shortage of frequencies and other broadcasting outlets. The free market will not provide</text>
<text top="238" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">for broadcasting the same variety found in the range of press and magazine titles. Hence programme</text>
<text top="253" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">content should be regulated and the media monopolies should be cut down by the application of</text>
<text top="269" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">anti-trust laws. Thus both the US and the German arguments lay stress on the power of television</text>
<text top="284" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">and its unique capacity to influence the public. According to the learned author, the arguments are</text>
<text top="299" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">difficult to assess. Broadcasting does not intrude into the home unless listeners and viewers want it</text>
<text top="315" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">to be. From the point of view of constitutional principles it is not easy to justify imposition of greater</text>
<text top="330" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">limits on the medium on the ground that it is more influential than the written words. It cannot be</text>
<text top="346" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">right to subject more persuasive types of speech to greater restraints than those-imposed on less</text>
<text top="361" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">effective varieties. The author, however, accepts the view of the majority of the US Supreme Court in</text>
<text top="376" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">Pacifica case [supra] which regarded broadcasting, particularly television, as a uniquely pervasive</text>
<text top="392" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">presence in the lives of most people. More time is spent watching television than reading. The</text>
<text top="407" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">presence of sound and picture in any home makes it an exceptional potent medium. It may also be</text>
<text top="423" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">harder to stop children having access to 'adult material' on television than to pornographic</text>
<text top="438" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">magazines. This may not apply to subscription channels, enjoyment of which is dependent on a</text>
<text top="453" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">special decoder. He also agrees that experience in the United States and more recently in Italy</text>
<text top="469" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">suggests that a free broadcasting market does not produce the same variety as the press and book</text>
<text top="484" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">publishing markets do. However, the author states that these three justifications for broadcasting</text>
<text top="500" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">regulation are inconclusive and it is doubtful whether the case is powerful enough to justify the</text>
<text top="515" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">radically different legal treatment of the press and broadcasting media. A separate question,</text>
<text top="530" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">according to the author, is whether it is appropriate to continue to treat radio in the same way as</text>
<text top="546" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">television since there is generally a large choice of local, if not national radio programmes and it is</text>
<text top="561" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">hard to believe that it exercises a dominating influence on the formation of public attitudes. The</text>
<text top="577" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">same question arises In respect of cable television. Although a licence has to be obtained from a</text>
<text top="592" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">licensing authority, several franchises may be physically accommodated and a wide band cable</text>
<text top="607" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">system may be able to carry upto 30 or 40 or even more channels. The scarcity rational, therefore,</text>
<text top="623" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">seems inapplicable to cable, and further it is hard to believe that this mode of broadcasting exercises</text>
<text top="638" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">such a strong influence that stringent programme regulation is justifiable. Dealing with the last</text>
<text top="654" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">reason advocated by a leading American scholar, Lee Bollinger in his article &#34;Freedom of the Press</text>

<text top="68" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">as it has treated the cinema with more caution than it has the theater. This argument of Bollinger is</text>
<text top="84" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">based on the history of the two media. Bollinger's second argument is that society is entitled to</text>
<text top="99" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">remedy the deficiencies of an unregulated press with a regulated broadcasting system which may be</text>
<text top="115" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">preferable to attempting to regulate both sectors... According to Bollinger, regulation poses the</text>
<text top="130" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">danger of Government con- trol, a risk which is reduced if one branch of the media is left free. The</text>
<text top="145" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">author attacks this reason given by Bollinger and states that it is an unsatisfactory compro- mise. If</text>
<text top="161" left="72" width="153" height="12" font="0">the regulation of the press is al-</text>
<text top="192" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">ways wrong and perhaps unconstitutional and if there is no significant difference between the two</text>
<text top="207" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">media, it follows that the latter should also be wholly unregulated. The author also points out that</text>
<text top="222" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">Bollinger's argument attempts to justify the unequal treatment of the liberties of the broadcasters</text>
<text top="238" left="72" width="460" height="12" font="0">and newspaper proprietors and editors when in all material respects, their position is identical.</text>

<text top="284" left="72" width="424" height="12" font="0">Broadcasting case [supra] by White, J. of the US Supreme Court in the following words:</text>
<text top="315" left="108" width="415" height="12" font="0">&#34;But the people as a whole retain their interest in free speech by radio and their</text>
<text top="330" left="108" width="415" height="12" font="0">collective right to have the medium function consistently with the ends and purposes</text>
<text top="346" left="108" width="415" height="12" font="0">of the First Amendment. It is the right of viewers and listeners, not the right of the</text>
<text top="361" left="108" width="172" height="12" font="0">broadcasters, which is paramount&#34;.</text>
<text top="392" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">41.The author concludes by pointing out that the cases from a variety of jurisdictions show that the</text>
<text top="407" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">broadcasters programme freedom when exercised within the constraints imposed by the regulatory</text>
<text top="423" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">authority, has priority over the rights claimed by viewers to see a particular programme or to retain</text>
<text top="438" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">a particular series in the schedule. On the other hand, the interests of viewers and listeners justify</text>
<text top="453" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">the imposition of programme standards which would not be countenanced for the press or</text>
<text top="469" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">publishing. It is recognised by the constitutional courts of European countries that viewers and</text>
<text top="484" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">listeners have interests, and they should be taken into account in the interpretation' of broadcasting</text>
<text top="500" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">freedom. But the balancing of the rights of the broadcasters and viewers is done by regulatory</text>
<text top="515" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">authority. Courts are understandably reluctant to contemplate the interference with administrative</text>
<text top="530" left="72" width="352" height="12" font="0">discretion which would result from their recognition of individual rights.</text>
<text top="561" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">42.Dealing with the right to access to broadcasting, the author points out that the theoretical</text>
<text top="577" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">argument in this connection is that freedom of speech means freedom to communicate effectively to</text>
<text top="592" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">a mass audience and nowadays that entails access to the mass media. The rights to access provide</text>
<text top="607" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">some compensation for the expropriation by the public monopoly of the freedom to broadcast. In</text>
<text top="623" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">the absence of a justification for that monopoly, there would be a right to broadcast in the same way</text>
<text top="638" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">that everyone has a right to say or write what he likes in his own home. This would justify the</text>
<text top="654" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">recognition of access to both public and private channels. The -author states that these arguments</text>
<text top="669" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">are unacceptable. Freedom of speech does not entail any right to communicate effectively in the</text>
<text top="684" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">sense that a citizen can call upon the State to provide him with the most effective means for the</text>
<text top="700" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">purpose. He points out that no legal system provides its citizens with the means and opportunities</text>

<text top="207" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">for courts are not competent to formulate them with any precision. Dealing with the constitutional</text>
<text top="222" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">rights of access to the broadcasting media, the author concludes that individuals and groups do not</text>
<text top="238" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">have constitutional rights of access to the broadcasting media. Access rights can only be framed</text>
<text top="253" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">effectively by legislature or by specialist administrative agencies. It does not mean that statutory or</text>
<text top="269" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">other access rights do not have a constitutional dimension. The courts may lay down that some</text>
<text top="284" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">provisions should be made for access as a matter of constitutional policy. This, however, does not</text>
<text top="299" left="72" width="297" height="12" font="0">mean that there are individual constitutional rights to access.</text>
<text top="330" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">43. In this connection, the author also points out that the development of cable poses new access</text>
<text top="346" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">problems. Operator of the cable may himself have rights of free speech which would be infringed by</text>
<text top="361" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">a requirement to honour access claims. The scarcity and economic arguments which are employed</text>
<text top="376" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">to justify broadcasting regulation and, therefore, access provision, may be less applicable in the</text>
<text top="392" left="72" width="79" height="12" font="0">context of cable.</text>
<text top="423" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">44. We may now summarise the law on the freedom of speech and expression under Article 19 [1]</text>
<text top="438" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">(a) as restricted by Article 19 [2]. The freedom of speech and expression includes right to acquire</text>
<text top="453" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">information and to disseminate it. Freedom of speech and expression is necessary, for self</text>
<text top="469" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">expression which is an important means of free conscience and self fulfillment. It enables people to</text>
<text top="484" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">contribute to debates of social and moral issues. It is the best way to find a truest model of anything,</text>
<text top="500" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">since it is only through it, that the widest possible range of ideas can circulate. It is the only vehicle</text>
<text top="515" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">of political discourse so essential to democracy. Equally important is the role it plays in facilitating</text>
<text top="530" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">artistic and scholarly endeavours of all sorts. The right to communicate, therefore, includes right to</text>
<text top="546" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">communicate through any media that is available whether print or electronic or audio-visual such as</text>
<text top="561" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">advertisement, movie, article, speech etc. That is why freedom of speech and expression includes</text>
<text top="577" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">freedom of the press. The freedom of the press in terms includes right to circulate and also to</text>
<text top="592" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">determine the volume of such circulation. This freedom includes the freedom to communicate or</text>
<text top="607" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">circulate one's opinion without interference to as large a population in the country as well as abroad</text>
<text top="623" left="72" width="110" height="12" font="0">as impossible to reach.</text>
<text top="654" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">45. This fundamental right can be limited only by reasonable restrictions under a law made for</text>
<text top="669" left="72" width="269" height="12" font="0">purpose mentioned in Article 19 [2] of the Constitution.</text>
<text top="700" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">46. The burden is on the authority to justify the restrictions. Public order is not the same thing as</text>
<text top="715" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">public safety and hence no restrictions can be placed on the right to freedom of speech and</text>

<text top="68" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">limitations on fundamental rights are specifi- cally spelt out under Article 19 [2] of our Constitution.</text>
<text top="84" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">Hence no restrictions can be placed on the right to freedom of speech and expression on grounds</text>
<text top="99" left="72" width="226" height="12" font="0">other than those specified under Article 19 [2].</text>
<text top="130" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">47. What distinguishes the electronic media like they television from the print media or other media</text>
<text top="145" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">is that it has both audio and visual appeal and has a more pervasive presence. It has a greater impact</text>
<text top="161" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">on the minds of the viewers and is also more readily accessible to all including children at home.</text>
<text top="176" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">Unlike the print media, however, there is a built-in limitation on the use of electronic media because</text>
<text top="192" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">the airwaves are a public property and hence are owned or controlled by the Government or a</text>
<text top="207" left="72" width="485" height="12" font="0">central national authority or they are not available on account of the scarcity, costs and competition.</text>
<text top="238" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">48. The next question to be answered in this connection is whether there can be a monopoly in</text>
<text top="253" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">broadcasting/telecasting. Broadcasting is a means of communication and, therefore, a medium of</text>
<text top="269" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">speech and expression. Hence in a democratic polity, neither any private individual, institution or</text>
<text top="284" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">Organisation nor any Government or Government Organisation can claim exclusive right over It.</text>
<text top="299" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">Our Constitution also forbids monopoly either in the print or electronic media. The monopoly</text>
<text top="315" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">permitted by our Constitution is only in respect of carrying on a trade, business, industry or service</text>
<text top="330" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">under Article 19 [6] to subserve the interests of the general public. However, the monopoly in</text>
<text top="346" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">broadcasting and telecasting is often claimed by the Government to utilise the public resources in</text>
<text top="361" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">the form of the limited frequencies available for the benefit of the society at large. It is Justified by</text>
<text top="376" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">the Government to prevent the concentration of the frequencies in the hands of the rich few who can</text>
<text top="392" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">information to suit their interests and thus in fact to control and manipulate public opinion in effect</text>
<text top="407" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">smothering the right to freedom of speech and expression and freedom of information of others. The</text>
<text top="423" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">claim to monopoly made on this ground may, however, lose all its raison d'etre if either any section</text>
<text top="438" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">of the society is unreasonably denied an access to broadcasting or the Governmental agency claims</text>
<text top="453" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">exclusive right to prepare and relay programmes. The ground is further not available when those</text>
<text top="469" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">claiming an access either do not make a demand on the limited frequencies controlled by the</text>
<text top="484" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">Government or claim the frequency which is not utilised and is available for transmission. The</text>
<text top="500" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">Government sometimes claims monopoly also on the ground that having regard to all pervasive</text>
<text top="515" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">presence and impact of the electronic media, it may be utilised for purposes not permitted by law</text>
<text top="530" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">and the damage done by private broadcasters may be irreparable. There is much to be said in favour</text>
<text top="546" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">of this view and it is for this reason that the regulatory provisions including those for granting</text>
<text top="561" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">licences to private broadcasting where it is permitted, are enacted. On the other hand, if the</text>
<text top="577" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">Government is vested with an unbridled discretion to grant or refuse to grant the license or access to</text>
<text top="592" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">the media, the reason for creating monopoly will lose its validity. For then it is the government</text>
<text top="607" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">which will be enabled to effectively suppress the freedom of speech and expression instead of</text>
<text top="623" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">protecting it and utilising the licensing power strictly for the purposes for which it is conferred. It is</text>
<text top="638" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">for this reason that in most of the democratic countries an independent autonomous broadcasting</text>
<text top="654" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">authority is created to control all aspects of the operation of the electronic media. Such authority is</text>

<text top="68" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">monopoly of broadcasting/telecasting in the Government. The Indian Telegraph Act, 1885</text>

<text top="115" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">the Rules made thereunder empower the Government to pre-censor films. However, the power</text>
<text top="130" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">given to the Government to license and to pre-censor under the respective legislations has to be read</text>
<text top="145" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">in the context of Article 19 [2] of the Constitution which sets the parameters of reasonable</text>

<text top="176" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">emphasise that the power to pre-censor films and to grant licences for access to telecasting, has to</text>

<text top="469" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">maintain a telegraph because in the present case the permission is sought only for operating a</text>

<text top="500" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">is non-commercial. It is to relay the specific number of cricket matches. It is only incidentally that</text>
<text top="515" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">the CAB will earn some revenue by selling its right to relay the matches organised by it. The CAB is</text>
<text top="530" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">obviously not a business or a commercial organisation nor can it be said that it is organising</text>
<text top="546" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">matches for earning profits as a business proposition. As will be pointed out later, it is a sporting</text>

<text top="68" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">cannot be disputed that the BCCI is a non-profit making Organisation which controls officially</text>
<text top="84" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">organised game of cricket in India. Similarly, Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) is also non- profit</text>
<text top="99" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">making Organisation which controls officially organised game of cricket in the State of West Bengal.</text>
<text top="115" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">The CAB is one of the Founder Members of BCCI. Office bearers and Members of the Working</text>
<text top="130" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">Committees of both BCCI and CAB are all citizens of India. The primary object of both the</text>
<text top="145" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">organisations, amongst others, is to promote the game of cricket, to foster the spirit of</text>
<text top="161" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">sportsmanship and the ideals of cricket, and to impart education through the media of cricket, and</text>
<text top="176" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">for achieving the said objects, to organise and stage tournaments and matches either with the</text>
<text top="192" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">members of International Cricket Council (ICC) or other organisations. According to CAB, BCCI is</text>
<text top="207" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">perhaps the only sports- organisation in India which cams foreign exchange and is neither</text>
<text top="222" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">controlled by any Governmental agency nor receives any financial assistance or grants, of</text>
<text top="238" left="72" width="93" height="12" font="0">whatsoever nature.</text>
<text top="269" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">55. It cannot be disputed further that to arrange any international cricket tournament or series. it is</text>
<text top="284" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">necessary and a condition-precedent, to pay to the participating member countries or teams, a</text>
<text top="299" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">minimum guaranteed amount in foreign exchange and to bear expenses incurred for travelling,</text>
<text top="315" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">boarding, lodging and other daily expenses for the participating cricketeers and the concerned</text>
<text top="330" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">accompanying visiting officials. A huge amount of expenses has also to be incurred for organising</text>
<text top="346" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">the matches. In addition, both BCCI and CAB annually incur large amount of expenses for giving</text>
<text top="361" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">subsidies and grants to its members to maintain, de- velop and upgrade the infrastructure, to coach</text>
<text top="376" left="72" width="440" height="12" font="0">and train players and umpires, and to pay to them when the series and matches are played.</text>
<text top="407" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">56.Against this background, we may now examine the questions of law raised by the parties. The</text>
<text top="423" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">contention of the Min- istry of Information and Broadcasting (MIB) is that there is a difference</text>
<text top="438" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">between the implications of the right conferred under Article 19 [1] (a) upon [i] the broadcaster i.e.</text>
<text top="453" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">the person operating the media, [ii] the person desiring access to the media to project his views</text>
<text top="469" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">including the organiser of an event, [iii] the viewer and [iv] a person seeking uplinking of</text>
<text top="484" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">frequencies so as to telecast signals generated in India to other countries. The contention of CAB</text>
<text top="500" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">that denial of a license to telecast through a media of its choice, based [according to NM] upon the</text>
<text top="515" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">commercial interests, infringes viewers' right under Article 19 [1] (a) is untenable. It is further</text>
<text top="530" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">contended that the commercial interests of the organizer are not protected by Article 19 [1] (a).</text>
<text top="546" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">However, the contention of the CAB results indirectly in such protection being sought by resort to</text>
<text top="561" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">the following steps of reasoning : [a] the, Board has a right to commercially exploit the event to the</text>
<text top="577" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">maximum, [b] the viewer has a right to access to the event through the television. Hence the Board</text>
<text top="592" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">has the right to telecast through an appropriate channel and also the right to insist, that a private</text>
<text top="607" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">agency including a foreign agency, should be allowed all the sanctions and permissions as may be</text>
<text top="623" left="72" width="92" height="12" font="0">necessary therefor.</text>
<text top="654" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">57.According to NUB the aforesaid contention is untenable because even if it is assumed that</text>
<text top="669" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">entertainment is a part of free speech, the analogy of the right of the press under Article 19 [1] (a)</text>

<text top="53" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">(g), cannot be extended to the right of sports associations. The basic premise underlying the</text>
<text top="68" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">recognition of the rights of the press under Article 19 [1] (a) is that the economic strength is vitally</text>
<text top="84" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">necessary to ensure independence of the press, and thus even the 'business' elements of a newspaper</text>
<text top="99" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">have 'to some extent a 'free speech' protection. In other words the commercial element of the press</text>
<text top="115" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">exists to subserve the basic object of the press, namely, free dissemination of news and views which</text>
<text top="130" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">enjoys the protection of free speech. However, free speech element in telecast of sports is incidental.</text>
<text top="145" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">According to the MIB, the primary object of the telecast by the CAB is to raise funds and hence the</text>
<text top="161" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">ac- tivities are essentially of trade. The fact that the profits are deployed for promotion of sports is</text>
<text top="176" left="72" width="134" height="12" font="0">immaterial for the purpose.</text>
<text top="207" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">58. It is further urged that a broadcaster does not have a right as such to access to the airwaves</text>
<text top="222" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">without a license either for the purposes of telecast or for the purposes of uplinking. Secondly, there</text>
<text top="238" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">is no general right to a license to use airwaves which being a scarce resource, have to be used in a</text>
<text top="253" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">manner that the interests of the largest number are best served. The paramount interest is that of</text>
<text top="269" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">the viewers. The grant of a license does not confer any special right inasmuch as the refusal of a</text>
<text top="284" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">license does not result in the denial of a right to free speech. Lastly, the nature of the electronic</text>
<text top="299" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">media is such that it necessarily involves the marshaling of the resources for the largest public good.</text>
<text top="315" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">The state monopoly created as a device, to use the resource is not per se violative of the right of free</text>
<text top="330" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">speech as long as the paramount interests of the viewers are subserved and access to the media is</text>
<text top="346" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">governed by the fairness doctrine. According to the MIB, the width of the rights under Article 19 [1]</text>
<text top="361" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">(a) has never been considered to be wider than that conferred by the First Amendment to the U.S.</text>
<text top="376" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">Constitution. It is also urged that the licensing of frequencies and consequent regulation of</text>
<text top="392" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">telecast/broadcast would not be a matter covered by Article 19 [2]. The-right to telecast/broadcast</text>
<text top="407" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">has certain inherent limitations imposed by nature, whereas Article 19(2) applies to restrictions</text>
<text top="423" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">imposed by the State. The object of licensing is not to cast restrictions on the expression of ideas, but</text>
<text top="438" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">to regulate and Marshall scarce resources to ensure their optimum enjoyment by all including those</text>
<text top="453" left="72" width="252" height="12" font="0">who are not affluent enough to dominate the media.</text>
<text top="484" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">59.It is next urged that the rights of an organiser to use airwaves as a medium to telecast and</text>
<text top="500" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">thereby propagate his views, are distinct from his right to commercially exploit the event. Although</text>
<text top="515" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">it is conceded that an organiser cannot be denied access on impermissible grounds, it is urged that</text>
<text top="530" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">he cannot further claim a right to use an agency of his choice as a part of his right of free speech. In</text>
<text top="546" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">any event no person can claim to exercise his right under Article 19 [1] (a) in a manner which makes</text>
<text top="561" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">it a device for a non- citizen to assert rights which are denied by the Constitution. According to MIB,</text>
<text top="577" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">it is the case of the BCCI that to promote its commercial interest, it is entitled to demand that the</text>
<text top="592" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">Government grants all the necessary licenses and permissions to any foreign agency of its choice and</text>
<text top="607" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">a refusal to do so would violate Article 19 [1] (a). According to MIB, this is an indirect method to</text>
<text top="623" left="72" width="263" height="12" font="0">seek protection of Article 19 [1] (a) to the non-citizens.</text>
<text top="654" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">60. It is then contended that a free speech right of a viewer has been recognised as that having a</text>
<text top="669" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">paramount im- portance by the US Supreme Court and this view is all the more significant in a</text>
<text top="684" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">country like ours. While accepting that the electronic media is undoubtedly the most powerful</text>
<text top="700" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">media of communication both from the perspective of its reach as well as its impact, transcending</text>
<text top="715" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">all barriers in- cluding that of illiteracy, it is contended that it is very cost-intensive. Unless,</text>

<text top="161" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">conferred upon DD is violative of Article 19 [1] (a), while objecting to the contention on the ground</text>
<text top="176" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">that the issue does not arise in the present proceedings and is not raised in the pleadings, it is</text>
<text top="192" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">submitted on behalf of NM that the principal contentions of the CAB/BCCI are that they are entitled</text>
<text top="207" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">to market their right to telecast event at the highest possible value it may command and if the DD is</text>
<text top="222" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">unwilling to pay as much as the highest bidder, the CAB/BCCI has the right not only to market the</text>
<text top="238" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">event but to demand as of right, all the necessary licences and permissions for the agency including</text>
<text top="253" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">foreign agency which has purchased its rights. According to MIB these contentions do not raise any</text>
<text top="269" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">free-speech issues, but impinge purely on the right to trade. As far as Article 19 [1] (g) is concerned,</text>
<text top="284" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">the validity of the monopoly in favour of the Government is beyond question. Secondly, in the</text>
<text top="299" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">present case, the DD did not refuse to telecast the event per se. It is then submitted that the</text>
<text top="315" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">CAB/BCCI are not telecasters. They arc only organisers of the events sought to be telecast and when</text>
<text top="330" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">the agency like DD which has access to the largest number of viewers agrees to telecast the events,</text>
<text top="346" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">their right as well as the viewers' right under Article 19 [1] (a) is satisfied. No organiser, it is</text>
<text top="361" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">contended, can insist that his event be telecast on terms dictated by him and refusal to agree to his</text>
<text top="376" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">term constitutes, breach of his right under Article 19 [1] (a). If it is accepted that the Government</text>
<text top="392" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">has not only the, right but the duty to regulate the distribution of frequencies, then the only way it</text>
<text top="407" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">can be done is by creating a monopoly. A mere creation of the monopoly-agency to tele- cast does</text>
<text top="423" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">not per se violate Article 19 [1] (a) as long as the access is not denied to the media either absolutely</text>
<text top="438" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">or by imposition of terms which are unreasonable. Article 19 [1] (a) proscribes monopoly in ideas</text>
<text top="453" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">and as long as this is not done, the mere -fact that the access to the media is through the</text>
<text top="469" left="72" width="354" height="12" font="0">Government-controlled agency, is not per se violative of Article 19 [1] (a).</text>

<text top="530" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">Government is in substance over the content on the grounds other than those specified in Article 19</text>
<text top="546" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">[2] or a general permission to all who seek frequencies to telecast, would better subserve the</text>

<text top="284" left="72" width="448" height="12" font="0">imposed fall outside the ambit of Article 19(2) and are unconstitutional. The restrictions are:</text>

<text top="469" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">the American decisions relied upon on behalf of MIB have no bearing on the present state of affairs.</text>

<text top="376" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">content of Article 19 [1] (a) nor does it become an exercise of right by a non-citizens. In this</text>
<text top="392" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">connection, it is emphasised that the DD is also using Worldtel, a foreign agency. Most of the</text>
<text top="407" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">newspapers in India are printed on machines imported from abroad. A newspaper may also have a</text>
<text top="423" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">foreigner as its manager. However, that does not take away the right of the newspaper under Article</text>
<text top="438" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">19 [1] (a). They are only instances of technical collaboration. Apart from it, every citizen has a right</text>
<text top="453" left="72" width="386" height="12" font="0">to information as the same cannot be taken away on grounds urged by the NEB.</text>
<text top="484" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">77.It will be apparent from the contentions advanced on behalf of MIB that their main thrust is that</text>
<text top="500" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">the right claimed by the BCCI/CAB is not the right of freedom of speech under Article 19 [1] (a), but</text>
<text top="515" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">a commercial right or the right to trade under Article 19 [1] (g). The contention is based mainly on</text>
<text top="530" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">two grounds viz., there is no free speech element in the telecast of sports and secondly, the primary</text>
<text top="546" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">object of the BCCI/CAB in seeking to telecast the cricket matches is not to educate and entertain the</text>
<text top="561" left="72" width="131" height="12" font="0">viewer but to make money.</text>
<text top="592" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">78.It can hardly be denied that sport is an expression of self In an athletic Nor individual event, the</text>
<text top="607" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">individual expresses himself through his individual feat. In a team event such as cricket, football,</text>
<text top="623" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">hockey etc., there is both individual and collective expression. It may be true that what is protected</text>
<text top="638" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">by Article 19 [1] (a) is an expression of thought and feeling and not of the physical or intellectual</text>

<text top="669" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">a participant in the game, does not seek to exercise his right of self expression. However, the right to</text>
<text top="684" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">freedom of speech and expression also includes the right to educate, to inform and to entertain and</text>

<text top="145" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">whose only intention is to make as large a profit as can be made by telecasting the game. Whereas it</text>
<text top="161" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">can be said that there is hardly any free speech element in the right to telecast when it is asserted by</text>
<text top="176" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">the latter, it will be a warped and cussed view to take when the former claim the same right, and</text>
<text top="192" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">contend that in claiming the right to telecast the cricket matches organised by them, they are</text>
<text top="207" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">asserting the right to make business out of it. The sporting organisations such as BCCI/ CAB which</text>
<text top="222" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">are interested in promoting the sport or sports are under an obligation to organise the sports events</text>
<text top="238" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">and can legitimately be accused of failing in their duty to do so. The promotion of Sports also</text>
<text top="253" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">includes its popularization through all legitimate means. For this purpose, they are duty bound to</text>
<text top="269" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">select the best means and methods to reach the maximum number of listeners and viewers. Since at</text>
<text top="284" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">present, radio and TV are the most efficacious methods, thanks to the technological development,</text>
<text top="299" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">the sports organisations like BCCI/CAB will be neglecting their duty in not exploring the said media</text>
<text top="315" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">and in not employing the best means available to them to popularise the game. That while pursuing</text>
<text top="330" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">their objective of popularising the sports by selecting the best available means of doing so, they</text>
<text top="346" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">incidentally earn some revenue, will not convert either them into commercial organisations or the</text>
<text top="361" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">right claimed by them to explore the said means, into a commercial right or interest. It must further</text>
<text top="376" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">be remembered that sporting organisations such as BCCI/CAB in the present case, have not been</text>
<text top="392" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">established only to organise the sports events or to broadcast or telecast them. The organisation of</text>
<text top="407" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">sporting events is only a part of their various objects, as pointed out earlier and even when they</text>
<text top="423" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">organise the events, they are primarily to educate the sportsmen, to promote and popularise the</text>
<text top="438" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">sports and also to inform and entertain the viewers. The Organisation of such events involves huge</text>
<text top="453" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">costs. Whatever surplus is left after defraying all the expenses, is ploughed back by them in the</text>
<text top="469" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">Organisation itself It will be taking a deliberately dis- torted view of the right claimed by such</text>
<text top="484" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">organisations to telecast the sporting event to call it an assertion of a commercial right. Yet the MIB</text>
<text top="500" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">has chosen to advance such contention which can only be described as most unfortunate. It is</text>
<text top="515" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">needless to state that we are, in the circumstances, unable to accept the ill-advised argument. It does</text>
<text top="530" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">no credit to the Ministry or to the Government as a whole to denigrate the sporting organisations</text>
<text top="546" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">such as BCCI/CAB by placing them on par with business organisations sponsoring sporting events</text>
<text top="561" left="72" width="441" height="12" font="0">for profit and the access claimed by them to telecasting as assertion of commercial interest.</text>
<text top="592" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">79.The second contention of NM is based upon the propositions laid down by the US Supreme</text>
<text top="607" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">Court, viz., there are inherent limitations imposed on the right to telecast/broadcast as there is</text>
<text top="623" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">scarcity of resources, i.e. of frequencies, and therefore the need to use them in the interest of the</text>
<text top="638" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">largest number. There is also a pervasive presence of electronic media such as TV. It has a greater</text>
<text top="654" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">impact on the minds of the people of all ages and strata of the society necessitating the prerequisite</text>
<text top="669" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">of licensing of the programmes. It is also contended on that account that the licensing of frequencies</text>
<text top="684" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">and consequent regulation of telecasting/broadcasting would not be a matter governed by Article 19</text>
<text top="700" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">[2]. Whereas Article 19 [2] applies to restric- tions imposed by the State, the inherent limitations on</text>
<text top="715" left="72" width="260" height="12" font="0">the right to telecast/broadcast are imposed by nature.</text>

<text top="53" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">80.In the first instance, it must be remembered that all the decisions of the US Supreme Court relied</text>
<text top="68" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">upon in support of this contention, are on the right of the private broadcasters to establish their own</text>
<text top="84" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">broadcasting stations by claiming a share in or access to the airwaves or frequen- cies. In the United</text>
<text top="99" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">States, there is no Central Government- owned or controlled broadcasting centre. There is only a</text>
<text top="115" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">Federal Commission to regulate broadcasting stations which are all owned by private broadcasters.</text>
<text top="130" left="72" width="141" height="12" font="0">Secondly, the American Con-</text>
<text top="161" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">stitution does not explicitly state the restrictions on the right of freedom of speech and expression as</text>
<text top="176" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">our Constitution does. Hence, the decisions in question have done no more than impliedly reading</text>
<text top="192" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">such restrictions. The decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court, therefore, in the context of the right</text>
<text top="207" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">claimed by the private broadcasters are irrelevant for our present purpose. In the present case, what</text>
<text top="222" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">is claimed is a right to an access to telecasting specific events for a limited duration and during</text>
<text top="238" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">limited hours of the day. There is no demand for owning or controlling a frequency. Secondly, unlike</text>
<text top="253" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">in the cases in the US which came for consideration before the US Supreme Court, the right to share</text>
<text top="269" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">in the frequency is not claimed without a license. Thirdly, the right to use a frequency for a limited</text>
<text top="284" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">duration is not claimed by a business Organisation to make profit and lastly and this is an important</text>
<text top="299" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">aspect of the present case, to which no reply has been given by the MIB, there is no claim to any</text>
<text top="315" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">frequency owned and controlled by the Government. What is claimed is a permission to uplink the</text>
<text top="330" left="72" width="314" height="12" font="0">signal created by the organiser of the events to a foreign satellite.</text>
<text top="361" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">81. There is no doubt that since the airwaves/frequencies are a public property and are also limited,</text>
<text top="376" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">they have to be used in the best interest of the society and this can be done either by a central</text>
<text top="392" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">authority by establishing its own broadcasting network or regulating the grant of licences to other</text>
<text top="407" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">agencies, including the private agencies. What is further, the electronic media is the most powerful</text>
<text top="423" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">media both because of its audio-visual impact, and its widest reach covering the section of the</text>
<text top="438" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">society where the print media does not reach. The right to use the airwaves and the content of the</text>
<text top="453" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">programmes therefore, needs regulation for balancing it and as well as to prevent monopoly of</text>
<text top="469" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">informa- tion and views relayed, which is a potential danger flowing from the concentration of the</text>
<text top="484" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">right to broadcast/telecast in the hands either of a central agency or of few private affluent</text>
<text top="500" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">broadcasters. That is why the need to have a central agency representative of all sections of the</text>
<text top="515" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">society free from control both of the Government and the dominant influential sections of the</text>
<text top="530" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">society. This is not disputed. But to contend that on that account the restrictions to be imposed on</text>
<text top="546" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">the right under Article 19 [1] (a) should be in addition to those permissible under Article 19 [2] and</text>
<text top="561" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">dictated by the use of public resources in the best interests of the society at large, is to misconceive</text>
<text top="577" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">both the content of the freedom of speech and expression and the problems posed by the element of</text>
<text top="592" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">public property in, and the alleged scarcity of, the frequencies as well as by the wider reach of the</text>
<text top="607" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">media. If the right to freedom of speech and expression includes the right to disseminate</text>
<text top="623" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">information to as wide a section of the population as is possible, the access which enables the right</text>
<text top="638" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">to be so exercised is also an integral part of the said right. The wider range of circulation of</text>
<text top="654" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">information or its greater impact cannot restrict the content of the right nor can it justify its denial.</text>
<text top="669" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">The virtues of the electronic media cannot become its enemies. It may warrant a greater regulation</text>
<text top="684" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">over licensing and control and vigilance on the content of the programme telecast. However, this</text>
<text top="700" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">control can only be exercised within the framework of Article 19 [2] and the dictates of public</text>
<text top="715" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">interests. To plead for other grounds is to plead for unconstitutional measures. It is further difficult</text>

<text top="53" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">to appreciate such contention on the part of the Government in this country when they have a</text>
<text top="68" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">complete control over the frequencies and the content of the programme to be telecast. They control</text>
<text top="84" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">the sole agency of telecasting. They are also armed with the provisions of Article 19 [2] and the</text>
<text top="99" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">powers of pre-censorship under the Cinematograph Act and Rules. The only limitations on the said</text>
<text top="115" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">right is, therefore, the limitation of resources and, the need to use them for the benefit of all. When,</text>
<text top="130" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">however, there are surplus or unlimited resources and the public interests so demand or in any case</text>
<text top="145" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">do not prevent telecasting, the validity of the argument based on limitation of resources disappears.</text>
<text top="161" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">It is true that to own a frequency for the purposes of broadcasting is a costly affair and even when</text>
<text top="176" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">there are surplus or unlimited frequencies, only the affluent few will own them and will be in a</text>
<text top="192" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">position to use it to subserve their own interest by manipulating news and views. That also poses a</text>
<text top="207" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">danger to the freedom of speech and expression of the have-nots by denying them the truthful</text>
<text top="222" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">information on all sides of an issue which is so necessary to form a sound view on any subject, That</text>
<text top="238" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">is why the doctrine of fairness which is evolved in the U.S. in the context of the private broadcasters</text>

<text top="269" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">programming. But this phenomenon occurs even in the case of the print media of all the countries.</text>
<text top="284" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">Hence the body like the Press Council of India which is empowered to enforce, however imperfectly,</text>
<text top="299" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">the right to reply. The print media further enjoys as in our country, freedom from pre-censorship</text>
<text top="315" left="72" width="135" height="12" font="0">unlike the electronic media.</text>
<text top="346" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">82.As -stated earlier, we are not concerned in the present case with the right of the private</text>
<text top="361" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">broadcasters, but only with the limited right for telecasting particular cricket matches for particular</text>
<text top="376" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">hours of the day and for a particular period. It is not suggested that the said right is objectionable on</text>
<text top="392" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">any of the grounds mentioned in Article 19 [2] or is against the proper use of the public resources.</text>
<text top="407" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">The only objection taken against the refusal to grant the said right is that of the limited resources.</text>
<text top="423" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">That objection is completely misplaced in the present case since the claim is not made on any of the</text>
<text top="438" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">frequencies owned, controlled and utilised by the D.D. The right claimed is for uplinking the signal</text>
<text top="453" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">generated by the BCCI/CAB to a satellite owned by another agency. The objection, therefore, is</text>
<text top="469" left="72" width="433" height="12" font="0">devoid of any merit and untenable in law. It also displays a deliberate obdurate approach.</text>
<text top="500" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">83.The third contention advanced on behalf of the MIB is only an extended aspect of the fist</text>

<text top="530" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">footing that the BCCI/CAB is claiming a commercial right to exploit the sporting event when they</text>
<text top="546" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">assert that they have a right to telecast the event through an agency of their choice. It is even</text>
<text top="561" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">contended on behalf of the MIB that this amounts to a device for a non-citizen to assert rights under</text>
<text top="577" left="72" width="233" height="12" font="0">Article 19 [1] .(a) which are not available to him.</text>
<text top="607" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">84.It is unnecessary to repeat what we have stated while dealing with the first contention earlier,</text>
<text top="623" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">with regard to the character of BCCI/CAB, the nature of and the purpose for which the right to</text>
<text top="638" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">access to telecast is claimed by them. As pointed out, it is not possible to hold that what the</text>
<text top="654" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">BCCI/CAB are in the present cast claiming is a commercial right to exploit the event unless one</text>
<text top="669" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">takes a perverse view of the matter. The extent of perversity is apparent from the contention raised</text>
<text top="684" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">by them that to engage a foreign agency for the purpose is to make it a device for a noncitizen to</text>
<text top="700" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">assert his rights under Article 19 [1] (a). It cannot be denied that the right to freedom of speech and</text>

<text top="130" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">of NUB, as pointed out earlier, is that the BCCI/CAB want to engage the foreign agency to maximise</text>
<text top="145" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">its revenue and hence they are not exercising their right under Article 19 [1] (a) but their commercial</text>
<text top="161" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">right under Article 19 [1] (g). We have pointed out that that argument is not factually correct and</text>
<text top="176" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">what in fact the BCCI/CAB is asserting is a right under Article 19 [1] (a). While asserting the said</text>
<text top="192" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">right, it is incidentally going to earn some revenue. In the circumstances, it has the right to choose</text>
<text top="207" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">the best method to earn the maximum revenue possible. In fact, it can be accused of negligence and</text>
<text top="222" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">may be attributed improper motives, if it fails to explore the most profitable avenue of telecasting</text>

<text top="284" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">permissions. All other Ministries and Departments understood them as such and granted the</text>
<text top="299" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">necessary permissions and licences. Hence, by granting such permission, the Government was not</text>
<text top="315" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">in fact granting permission to the foreign agency to exercise its right under Article 19 [1] (a). If,</text>
<text top="330" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">further, that was the only objection in granting permission, a positive approach on the part of the</text>
<text top="346" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">NM could have made it clear in the permission granted that it was being given to CAB. In fact, when</text>

<text top="423" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">85.The fourth contention is that, as held by the US Supreme Court, the freedom of speech has to be</text>
<text top="438" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">viewed also as a right of the viewers which has a paramount importance, and the said View has</text>
<text top="453" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">significance in a country like ours. To safeguard the rights of the viewers in this country, it is</text>
<text top="469" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">necessary to regulate and restrict the right to access to telecasting. There cannot be any dispute with</text>
<text top="484" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">this proposition. We have in fact referred to this right of the viewers in another context earlier. True</text>
<text top="500" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">democracy cannot exist unless all citizens have a right to participate in the affairs of the polity of the</text>
<text top="515" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">country. The right to participate in the affairs of the country is meaningless unless the citizens are</text>
<text top="530" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">well informed on all sides of the issues, in respect of which they are called upon to express their</text>
<text top="546" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">views. One-sided information, disinformation, misinformation and non-information all equally</text>
<text top="561" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">create an uninformed citizenry which makes democracy a farce when medium of information is</text>
<text top="577" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">monopolised either by a partisan central authority or by private individuals or oligarchic</text>
<text top="592" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">organisations. This is particularly so in a country like ours where about 65 per cent of the population</text>
<text top="607" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">is illiterate and hardly 1-1/2 per cent of the population has an access to the print media which is not</text>
<text top="623" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">subject to precensorship. When, therefore, the electronic media is controlled by one central agency</text>
<text top="638" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">or few private agencies of the rich, there is a need to have a central agency, as stated earlier,</text>
<text top="654" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">representing all sections of the society. Hence to have a representative central agency to ensure the</text>
<text top="669" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">viewers' right to be informed adequately and truthfully is a part of the right of the viewers under</text>
<text top="684" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">Article 19 [1] (a). We are, however, unable to appreciate this contention in the present context since</text>
<text top="700" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">the viewers' rights are not at all affected by the BCCI/CAB, by claiming a right to telecast the cricket</text>
<text top="715" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">matches, On the other hand, the facts on record show that their rights would very much be trampled</text>

<text top="84" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">only in this arena], it cannot be denied that a vast section of the people in this country is interested</text>
<text top="99" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">in viewing the cricket matches. The game of cricket is by far the most popular In all parts of the</text>
<text top="115" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">country. This is evident from the over-flowing stadia at the venues wherever the matches are played</text>
<text top="130" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">and they are played all over the country. It will not be an exaggeration to say that at least one in</text>
<text top="145" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">three persons, if not more, is interested in viewing the cricket matches. Almost all television sets are</text>
<text top="161" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">switched on to view the matches. Those who do not have a T.V. set of their own, crowd around T.V.</text>
<text top="176" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">sets of others when the matches are on. This is not to mention the number of transistors and radios</text>
<text top="192" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">which are on during the match-hours. In the face of these revealing facts, it is difficult to understand</text>
<text top="207" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">why the present contention with regard to the viewers' right is raised in this case when the grant of</text>
<text top="222" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">access to BCCI/CAB to telecast cricket matches was in the interest of the viewers and would have</text>
<text top="238" left="72" width="230" height="12" font="0">also contributed to promote their rights as well.</text>
<text top="269" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">86.The last argument on behalf of the MIB is that since in the present case, the DD has not refused</text>
<text top="284" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">to telecast the event, its monopoly to telecast cannot be challenged and in fact no such contention</text>
<text top="299" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">was raised by the BCCI/CAB. We are afraid that this will not be a proper reading of the contentions</text>
<text top="315" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">raised by BCCI/CAB in their pleadings both before the High Court and this Court. Undisputed facts</text>
<text top="330" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">on record show that the DD claimed exclusive right to create host broadcasting signal and to telecast</text>
<text top="346" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">it on the terms and conditions stipulated by it or not at all. MIB even refused to grant uplinking</text>
<text top="361" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">facilities when the terrestrial signal was being created by the CAB with their own apparatus, i.e., the</text>
<text top="376" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">apparatus of the agency which they had engaged and when the use of any of the frequencies owned,</text>
<text top="392" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">controlled or commanded by DD or the Government, was not involved. Since BCCI/CAB were the</text>
<text top="407" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">organisers of the events, they had every right to create terrestrial signals of their event and to sell it</text>
<text top="423" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">to whomsoever they thought best so long as such creation of the signal and the sale thereof was not</text>
<text top="438" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">violative of any law made under Article 19 [2] and was not an abuse of the frequencies which are a</text>
<text top="453" left="72" width="290" height="12" font="0">public property. Neither DD nor any other agency could im-</text>
<text top="484" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">pose their terms for creating signal or for telecasting them unless it was sought through their</text>
<text top="500" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">frequencies. When the DD refused to telecast cricket matches except on their terms, the BCCI/CAB</text>
<text top="515" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">turned to another agency, in the present case a foreign agency, for creating the terrestrial signal and</text>
<text top="530" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">telecasting it through the frequencies belonging to that agency. When the DD refused to telecast the</text>
<text top="546" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">matches, the rights of the viewers to view the matches were in jeopardy. Only the viewers in this</text>
<text top="561" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">country who could receive foreign frequencies on their TV sets, could have viewed the said matches.</text>
<text top="577" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">Hence it is not correct to say that the DD had not refused to telecast the events. To insist on</text>
<text top="592" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">telecasting events only on one's unreasonable terms and conditions and not otherwise when one has</text>
<text top="607" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">the monopoly of telecasting, is nothing but refusal to telecast the same. The DD could not do it</text>
<text top="623" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">except for reasons of non-availability of frequencies or for grounds available under Article 19(2) of</text>
<text top="638" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">the Constitution or for considerations of public interest in- volved in the use of the frequencies as</text>
<text top="654" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">public property. The fact that the DD was prepared to telecast the events only on its terms shows</text>
<text top="669" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">that the frequency was available. Hence, scarcity of frequencies or public interests cannot be pressed</text>
<text top="684" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">as grounds for refusing to telecast or denying access to BCCl/CAB to telecasting. Nor can the DD</text>
<text top="700" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">plead encroachment on the right of viewers as a ground since the telecasting of events on the terms</text>
<text top="715" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">of the DD cannot alone be said to safeguard the right of viewers in such a case and in fact it was not</text>

<text top="84" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">87.Coming to the facts of the present case, which have given rise to the present proceedings, the</text>
<text top="99" left="72" width="136" height="12" font="0">version of MIB is as follows:</text>
<text top="130" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">On March 15, 1993, the CAB wrote a letter to the Director General of Doordarshan that a Six-Nation</text>
<text top="145" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">International Cricket Tournament will be held in November, 1993 as a part of its Diamond Jubilee</text>
<text top="161" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">Celebrations and asked DD to send a detailed offer for any of the two alternatives, namely, (i) that</text>
<text top="176" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">DD would create 'Host Broadcaster Signal' and also undertake live telecast of all the matches in the</text>
<text top="192" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">tournament or (ii) any other party may create the 'Host Broadcaster Signal' and DD would only</text>
<text top="207" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">purchase the rights to telecast in India. CAB in particular emphasised that in either case, the foreign</text>
<text top="222" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">T.V. rights would be with CAB. The CAB also asked DD to indicate the royalty amount that would be</text>
<text top="238" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">paid by the DD. On March 18, 1993 the Controller of Programmes (Sports), DD, replied to the letter</text>
<text top="253" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">stating amongst other things that during the meeting and during the telephonic conversation, CAB's</text>
<text top="269" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">President Dalmia had agreed to send them in writing the amount that he expected as rights fee</text>
<text top="284" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">payable to CAB exclusively for India, without the Star TV getting it. On March 19, 1993, CAB</text>
<text top="299" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">informed DD that they would be agreeable to DD creating the Host Broadcaster Signal and also</text>
<text top="315" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">granting DD exclusive right for India without the Star TV getting it and the CAB would charge DD</text>
<text top="330" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">US $800,000 (US Dollars eight lakh] only] for the same. The CAB, however, made it clear that they</text>
<text top="346" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">would reserve the right to sell/li- cense the right world-wide, excluding India and Star TV. The CAB</text>
<text top="361" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">also stated that DD would be under an obligation to provide a picture and commentary subject to</text>
<text top="376" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">payment of DD's technical fees. On March 31, 1993, DD sent its bid as 'Host Broadcaster' for a sum</text>
<text top="392" left="72" width="445" height="12" font="0">of Rs. 1 crore stating inter alia, that CAB should grant signals to it exclusively for India with-</text>
<text top="423" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">out the Star TV getting it. The DD also stated that they would be in a position to create the 'Host</text>
<text top="438" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">Broadcaster Signal' and offer a live telecast of all the matches in the tournament. Thereafter, on May</text>
<text top="453" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">4, 1993, the DD by a fax message reminded the President of CAB about its offer of March 31, 1993.</text>
<text top="469" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">To that CAB replied on May 12, 1993 that as the Committee of CAB had decided to sell/allot</text>
<text top="484" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">worldwide TV rights to one party only, they would like to know whether DD would be interested in</text>
<text top="500" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">the deal and, if so, to send their offer for worldwide TV rights latest by May 17, 1993, on the</text>
<text top="515" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">following basis, namely, outright purchase of TV rights and sharing of rights fee. On May 14, 1993</text>
<text top="530" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">DD by its fax addressed to CAB stated that it was committed to its earlier bid of Rs. 1 crore, namely,</text>
<text top="546" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">exclusive TV right in India alone. The DD also stated that as there was a speculation that Pakistan</text>
<text top="561" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">may not participate in the tournament, which may affect viewership and consequent commercial</text>
<text top="577" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">accruals, DD would have to rethink on the said bid also, in such an even- tuality and requested CAB</text>
<text top="592" left="72" width="190" height="12" font="0">to reply to the said letter at the earliest.</text>
<text top="623" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">88. On June 14, 1993, according to the NUB, without obtaining the required clearances from the</text>
<text top="638" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">Government for telecasting, the CAB entered into an agreement with the World Production</text>

<text top="669" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">telecasting all the matches. The said agreement provided for the grant of sole and exclusive right to</text>

<text top="700" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">shall only retain radio rights for the territory of India. The CAB under the agreement was to receive</text>

<text top="130" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">89. On June 18, 1993, DD sent a fax to CAB stating therein that from the press reports, it had learnt</text>
<text top="145" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">that CAB had en- tered into an agreement with TWI for the TV coverage of the tournament, and the</text>

<text top="284" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">that no foreign national shall visit any restricted/protected/prohibited area of India without</text>
<text top="299" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">permission from the Ministry of Home Affairs. It was also clarified that the sanction of foreign</text>
<text top="315" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">exchange was subject to the condition that CAB would utilize only the minimum foreign exchange</text>
<text top="330" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">required for the purpose and shall deposit foreign exchange obtained by it by way of fee,</text>

<text top="469" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">TWI wrote to VSNL seeking frequency clearance from the Ministry of Communications. The TWI</text>

<text top="84" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">should come forward to telecast the matches since otherwise people in India would be deprived of</text>

<text top="53" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">102. What emerges from the above correspondence is as follows. The CAB as early as on 15th March,</text>
<text top="68" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">1993, had offered to the DD two alternatives, viz., either the DD would create host broadcaster</text>
<text top="84" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">signal and undertake live telecast of all the matches in the tournament or any other party may create</text>
<text top="99" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">the host broadcaster signal and DD would purchase from the said party the rights to telecast the said</text>
<text top="115" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">signal in India. The CAB made it clear that in either case, the foreign TV rights would remain with it.</text>
<text top="130" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">The CAB also asked the DD to indicate the royalty that it will be willing to pay in either case. To that,</text>
<text top="145" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">on 18th March, 1993, the DD rejoined by asking in turn the amount of royalty that the CAB expected</text>
<text top="161" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">if the rights were given to it exclusively for India without the. Star TV getting it. On 19th March,</text>
<text top="176" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">1993, the CAB informed the DD that they would charge US $8 lakhs for giving the DD the right to</text>
<text top="192" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">create the host broadcaster signal and also for granting it exclusive right for India without the Star</text>
<text top="207" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">TV getting it It was however, emphasised that the CAB would reserve the right to sell/license the</text>
<text top="222" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">right of broadcasting worldwide excluding India and the Star TV. The CAB also stated that the DD</text>
<text top="238" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">would be under an obligation to provide a picture and commentary subject to payment of DD's</text>
<text top="253" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">technical fees. On 31st March, 1993, the DD sent its bid as host broadcaster for a sum of Rs.1 crore</text>
<text top="269" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">[i.e.. about US $3.33 lakhs at the then exchange rate]. Obviously, this was less than 50 per cent of</text>
<text top="284" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">the royalty which was demanded by the CAB. The CAB was, therefore, justified in looking for other</text>
<text top="299" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">alternatives and that is what they did before the DD by a fax message of 4th May, 1993 reminded the</text>
<text top="315" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">CAB about DD's offer of Rs. 1 crore [i.e., US $3.33 lakhs]. To that message, the CAB replied on 12th</text>
<text top="330" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">May, 1993 that it had decided to sell/allot worldwide TV rights to only one party and, therefore, they</text>
<text top="346" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">would like to know whether the DD would be interested in the said deal and if so, to send their offer</text>
<text top="361" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">for worldwide TV rights, latest by 17th May, 1993. To this, on 14th May, 1993, the DD by Fax, replied</text>
<text top="376" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">that it was interested only in exclusive TV rights for India alone without the Star TV getting it and</text>
<text top="392" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">that it stood by its earlier offer of Rs. 1 crore [i.e., US $3.33 lakhs]. The DD went further and stated</text>
<text top="407" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">that as there was a speculation that-Pakistan might not participate in the tournament which</text>
<text top="423" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">eventuality was likely to affect viewership and commercial accruals, it will have to rethink on that</text>
<text top="438" left="72" width="361" height="12" font="0">bid also meaning thereby that even the offer of Rs. 1 crore may be reduced.</text>
<text top="469" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">103. According to the MIB, the CAB, thereafter, entered into an agreement with World Production</text>
<text top="484" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">Establishment representing the interests of TWI for telecasting all the matches without obtaining</text>
<text top="500" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">clearance from the Government for telecasting, and granted TWI sole and exclusive right to sell or</text>
<text top="515" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">otherwise exploit all exhibition rights of the tournament. Under the agreement with TWI, the CAB</text>
<text top="530" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">was to receive US $ 5.50 lakhs as guaranteed sum and in addition, if any rights fee income was</text>
<text top="546" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">received in excess of the guaranteed sum, it was to be. split in the ratio of 70:30 between the parties,</text>
<text top="561" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">i.e. 70 per cent to the CAB and 30 per cent to TWI. Learning of this, the DD informed the CAB that it</text>
<text top="577" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">had decided not to telecast the matches of the tournament by paying TWI TV rights fee and that it</text>
<text top="592" left="72" width="358" height="12" font="0">was not prepared to enter into any negotiations with TWI for the purpose.</text>
<text top="623" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">104. Again on 18th October, 1993, CAB addressed a letter to DD for telecasting the matches</text>
<text top="638" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">mentioning its earlier offer of rights for telecasting and pointed out that the offer of Rs. 1 crore made</text>
<text top="654" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">by DI) on the condition that the CAB should not grant any right 'to Star TV was uneconomical. CAB</text>
<text top="669" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">also pointed out that considering the enormous organisational costs involved, they were looking for</text>
<text top="684" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">a minimum offer of Rs.20 million.In this connection, they pointed out that the offers received by</text>
<text top="700" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">them from abroad-including from TWI were much higher than Rs.20 million and under those</text>
<text top="715" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">offers, the payment was also to be received in foreign exchange. The CAB further stated in that letter</text>

<page number="49" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="792" width="595">
<text top="53" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">that they were given to understand that DD was not interested in increasing their offer and hence</text>
<text top="68" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">they entered into a contract with TWI for telecasting the matches. Yet, they were keen that DD</text>
<text top="84" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">should telecast the matches since otherwise people in India would be deprived of viewing the same.</text>
<text top="99" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">They had, therefore, made the TWI agree for co-production with DD. They, therefore, requested the</text>
<text top="115" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">DD to agree to such co-production. The CAB also stated in the said letter that in fact in a joint</text>
<text top="130" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">meeting, details of such arrangement were worked out including the supply of equipment list by the</text>
<text top="145" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">respective parties and it was decided in principle to go in for joint production. In the meeting, it was</text>
<text top="161" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">further agreed that DD would not claim exclusive rights and the CAB would be at liberty to sell the</text>
<text top="176" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">rights to Star TV. However, since subsequently they had learnt from newspaper reports that DD had</text>
<text top="192" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">decided not to telecast the matches, by their letter of 15th September, 1993 they had asked DD to</text>
<text top="207" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">confirm the authenticity of the news items. The DD, however, had not responded to the said letter.</text>
<text top="222" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">In the meanwhile, many other networks had repeatedly approached them for telecasting matches to</text>
<text top="238" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">the Indian audience and some of them on exclusive basis. But they had still kept the matter pending</text>
<text top="253" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">since they did not want to deprive the viewers of the DD of the matches. They further added that</text>
<text top="269" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">they had also learnt that DD would be interested in acquiring rights of telecast provided it was</text>
<text top="284" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">allowed to produce some matches directly and the matches produced by TWI are made available to</text>
<text top="299" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">it live without payment of any technical fee. The CAB, therefore, in the circumstances, suggested a</text>
<text top="315" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">fresh set of proposals for DD's consideration and requested response be- fore 21st October, 1993. On</text>
<text top="330" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">27th October, 1993, DD responded to the said letter in the negative and stated that the offer made</text>
<text top="346" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">was not acceptable to it and they had already communicated to that effect earlier, stating that they</text>
<text top="361" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">will not take any signal from TWI. DD further denied that they had agreed to any joint production</text>
<text top="376" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">with TWI. The CAB by its letter of 29th October, 1993 pointed out, in response to this letter, that</text>
<text top="392" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">since they had also suggested production of live matches by DD, question of taking signals from TWI</text>
<text top="407" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">did not arise, and in deference to DD's sensitivity about taking signals from TWI, CAB would be</text>
<text top="423" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">quite happy to allow DD to produce its own picture of matches and DD may buy rights and licences</text>
<text top="438" left="72" width="259" height="12" font="0">from it at a price which will be mutually agreed upon.</text>
<text top="469" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">105. Thus, the controversy between the parties was with regard to the terms for the telecasting of the</text>
<text top="484" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">matches. It must be noted in this connection that the DD had never stated to the CAB that it had no</text>
<text top="500" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">frequency to spare for telecasting the matches. On the other hand, if the CAB had accepted the terms</text>
<text top="515" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">of the DD, DD was ready to telecast the matches. Therefore, the argument based on resource crunch</text>
<text top="530" left="72" width="358" height="12" font="0">as advanced on behalf of the MIB/ DD, is meaningless in the present case.</text>
<text top="561" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">106. All that we have to examine in the present case is whether the MIB/DD had stipulated</text>
<text top="577" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">unreasonable conditions for telecasting the matches. It is apparent from the above correspondence</text>
<text top="592" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">between the parties that CAB wanted a minimum of U.S. $8 lakhs, i.e., Rs.2.40 crores. However, DD</text>
<text top="607" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">insisted that it would be the host broadcaster and will have exclusive telecasting rights for India and</text>
<text top="623" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">for these rights. it will pay only Rs. 1 crore. i.e. US $3.33 lakhs. It had also threatened to reduce the</text>
<text top="638" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">said offer of Rs. one crore because Pakistan was not likely to participate in the tournament. When it</text>
<text top="654" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">was pointed out by the CAB that this offer was uneconomical taking. into consideration the</text>
<text top="669" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">enormous costs involved and that they were looking for a minimum of Rs. 2 crores and had received</text>
<text top="684" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">higher offers from other parties under which the payments will also be made in foreign exchange,</text>
<text top="700" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">DD stuck to its earlier offer and refused to raise it. In the meanwhile, the CAB received an offer of</text>
<text top="715" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">U.S. $5.50 lakhs, i.e., Rs. 1.65 crores from TWI as guaranteed sum plus a share to the extent of 70</text>

<text top="84" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">negotiating with TWI the terms and conditions of the deal. However, the only response of DD to</text>
<text top="99" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">these arrangements which were being worked out between the CAB and TWI was that it would not</text>
<text top="115" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">telecast the matches of the tournament by paying TWI the fees for purchasing the rights from that</text>

<text top="145" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">1993 informed the DD that it was keen that DD should telecast the matches so that people in India</text>
<text top="161" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">are not deprived of viewing the matches. They also informed the DD that it was with this purpose</text>
<text top="176" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">that they had made TWI agree for co-production with the DD and had made a fresh set of proposals.</text>
<text top="192" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">However, these proposals were on materially different terms. To this, the DD replied by its letters of</text>
<text top="207" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">27th October, 1993 that the terms and conditions of the offer were not ac- ceptable to it. The CAB by</text>
<text top="222" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">its letter of 29th October, 1993 again offered the DD that if their only objection was to taking signals</text>
<text top="238" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">from TWI, since they had suggested production of live matches by DD in their fresh proposals, there</text>
<text top="253" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">was no question of taking signals from TWI and they should reconsider the proposals. To this, the</text>
<text top="269" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">only reply of the DD was that they will not pay any Access Fee to CAB to telecast the matches and if</text>
<text top="284" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">DD were to telecast the matches, the CAB will have to pay Technical/Production Fee at the rate of</text>
<text top="299" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">Rs.5 lakhs per match, and in that case the DD will have exclusive rights for the signal generated, and</text>
<text top="315" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">the parties interested will have to take the signals from the DD after negotiating directly with it. In</text>
<text top="330" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">other words, the DD took the stand that not only it will not pay any charges to the CAB for the rights</text>
<text top="346" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">of telecasting the matches, but it is CAB which will have to pay the charges, and that the DD will be</text>
<text top="361" left="72" width="362" height="12" font="0">the sole producer of signals and others will have to buy the signals from it..</text>
<text top="392" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">107. Thus the correspondence between the parties shows that each of the parties was trying to score</text>
<text top="407" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">over the other by taking advantage of its position. The blame for the collapse of the negotiations has</text>
<text top="423" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">to be shared by both. The difference, if any, was only in the degree of unreasonableness. If anything,</text>
<text top="438" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">this episode once again emphasises the need to rescue the electronic media from the government</text>
<text top="453" left="72" width="481" height="12" font="0">monopoly and bureaucratic control and to have an independent authority to manage and control it.</text>
<text top="484" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">108. Coming now to the change in the, stand of the other Departments of the Government for</text>
<text top="500" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">granting facilities to the agency engaged by the CAB, the facts make a revealing reading. The actions</text>
<text top="515" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">of the various Departments of the Government, referred to earlier, show firstly, that the Min- istries</text>
<text top="530" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">of Human Resources Development, of Home Affairs, of Finance, of Communications, and the VSNL</text>
<text top="546" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">had no objection whatsoever to the arrangements which the CAB had entered into with TWI, the</text>
<text top="561" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">foreign agency, for covering the cricket matches. In fact they granted all the necessary permissions</text>
<text top="577" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">and facilities to the CAB/TWI in all respects subject to certain conditions with which neither the</text>
<text top="592" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">CAB nor TWI had any quarrel. Secondly, these various Departments had accepted TWI as the</text>
<text top="607" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">agency of CAB for the purposes of the said coverage and they had no objection to the TWI covering</text>
<text top="623" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">the matches on the ground that it was a foreign agency. This was the situation till the writ petition</text>
<text top="638" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">was filed by the CAB in the Calcutta High Court on 8th November, 1993. It is necessary to remember</text>

<text top="330" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">at [1] and [iii] of para 2 of the said ad hoc exemption order and, therefore, it should pay an amount</text>

<text top="469" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">permitting them to place their cameras at the requisite places, were heard by the Division Bench on</text>
<text top="484" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">14th November, 1993 when the match was already being played in Bombay. The Bench observed</text>

<text top="515" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">its earlier order and that what was required was certain clarification of that order in the changed</text>

<text top="561" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">According to the learned counsel for the Union of the India, there could be only one signalling from</text>
<text top="577" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">the field and DD should be treated as host broadcaster and the TWI should take signal from it. This</text>
<text top="592" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">was opposed by the learned counsel for the CAB who con- tended. that DD had been given exclusive</text>
<text top="607" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">right as host broadcaster so far as the telecasting of matches in India was concerned. The telecasting</text>
<text top="623" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">of matches abroad was to be done by TWI. The Division Bench held that the DD will have the</text>
<text top="638" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">exclusive right of signalling for the purposes of tele- casting within the country, and they were to be</text>
<text top="654" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">treated as host broadcasters so far as telecasting within India was concerned. As far as TWI is</text>
<text top="669" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">concerned, if it was authorised and permitted in terms of their earlier order, it would be entitled to</text>
<text top="684" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">telecast outside the country and to send their signal accordingly. They also stated that in case the</text>

<text top="561" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">&#34;In this connection, we have to take into account an important point brought to our notice by the</text>
<text top="577" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">Director General Doordarshan. It is true that Section 4 of the Indian Telegraph Act of 1885 enables</text>
<text top="592" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">the government to give licences to agencies other than Doordarshan or the government departments</text>
<text top="607" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">to telecast. In fact, such a permission had been given in January 1993 when the cricket matches were</text>
<text top="623" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">telecast by the same TWI. However, subsequently, I am given to understand that the government</text>
<text top="638" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">policy in the Ministry of I&amp;B has been that the uplinking directly by private parties/foreign agencies</text>
<text top="654" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">from India for the purpose of broadcasting should not be permitted. It is true that in a cricket match</text>
<text top="669" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">we are not considering security aspects. But, the point to be considered is whether uplinking. given</text>
<text top="684" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">in a particular case will have its consequences on other such claims which may not be directly linked</text>
<text top="700" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">to sports and which will have serious implications. Within the government, as per Allocation of</text>

<text top="53" left="72" width="326" height="12" font="0">implementation of the policies relating to broadcasting/telecasting.</text>
<text top="84" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">As was made clear earlier, in this case, we are considering two aspects. One is the generation of</text>
<text top="99" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">signals and the second is their communication. The Department of Telecommunication comes in the</text>
<text top="115" left="72" width="274" height="12" font="0">picture so far as the communication aspect is concerned.</text>
<text top="145" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">Taking into account the facts mentioned above, the only reasonable conclusion I reach is that</text>
<text top="161" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">permission may be given to TWI for telecast overseas through the VSNL, while Doordarshan will be</text>
<text top="176" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">telecasting within the country. The TWI will have to get the signals from Doordarshan for uplinking</text>
<text top="192" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">through the VSNL by making mutual arrangements. So far as VSNL is concerned, there should be no</text>
<text top="207" left="72" width="373" height="12" font="0">difficulty in transmitting the signals through Intelsat as already agreed upon.</text>
<text top="238" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">In my view, the above decision takes into account the needs of the millions of viewers both within</text>
<text top="253" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">the country and abroad who are keen to watch the game and at the same time ensures that there is</text>
<text top="269" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">no conflict with the broad government policy in the Ministry of I&amp;B which is entrusted with the task</text>
<text top="284" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">of broadcasting. It also takes into account the overall aspects and the reasonable expectation created</text>
<text top="299" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">within the TWI by the series of clearances given by the different authorities of the Government of</text>
<text top="315" left="72" width="33" height="12" font="0">India&#34;.</text>
<text top="346" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">119. This order which was passed around 7.30 p.m. was challenged by the CAB, and being an urgent</text>

<text top="376" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">Secretary to the extent that it imposed a condition that the TWI will have to get the signals from the</text>
<text top="392" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">DD for uplinking through the VSNL by making mutual arrangements. The Court directed that the</text>

<text top="423" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">being played, as directed by the Ministry of Home Affairs and that they will take care not to focus</text>

<text top="238" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">122. The law on the subject discussed earlier makes it clear that the fundamental right to freedom of</text>
<text top="253" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">speech and expression includes the right to communicate effectively and to as large a population not</text>
<text top="269" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">only in this country but also abroad, as is feasible. There are no geographical barriers on</text>
<text top="284" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">communication. Hence every citizen has a right to use the best means available for the purpose. At</text>
<text top="299" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">present, electronic media, viz., T.V. and radio, is the most effective means of communication. The</text>
<text top="315" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">restrictions which the electronic media suffers in addition to those suffered by the print media, are</text>
<text top="330" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">that [i] the airwaves are a public property and they have to be used for die benefit of the society at</text>
<text top="346" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">large, [ii] the frequencies are limited and [iii] media is subject to pre-censorship. The other</text>
<text top="361" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">limitation, viz., the reasonable restrictions imposed by law made for the purposes mentioned in</text>
<text top="376" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">Article 19 [2] is common to all the media. In the present case, it was not and cannot be the case of</text>
<text top="392" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">the NM that the telecasting of the cricket matches was not for the benefit of the society at large or</text>
<text top="407" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">not in the public interest and, therefore, not a proper use of the public property. It was not the case</text>
<text top="423" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">of the MIB that it was in violation of the provisions of Article 19 [2]. There was nothing to be</text>
<text top="438" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">pre-censored on the grounds mentioned in Article 19 [2]. As regards the limitation of resources,</text>
<text top="453" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">since the DD was prepared to'telecast the cricket matches, but only on its terms it could not plead</text>
<text top="469" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">that there was no frequency available for telecasting. The DD could also not have ignored the rights</text>
<text top="484" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">of the viewers which the High Court was at pains to emphasise while passing its orders and to which</text>
<text top="500" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">we have also made a reference. The CAB/BCCI being the organisers of the event had a right to sell</text>
<text top="515" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">the telecasting rights of its event to any agency. Assuming that the DD had no frequency to spare for</text>
<text top="530" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">telecasting the matches, the CAB could certainly enter into a contract with any agency including a</text>
<text top="546" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">foreign agency to telecast the said matches through that agency's frequency for the viewers in this</text>
<text top="561" left="72" width="238" height="12" font="0">country [who could have access to those frequen-</text>
<text top="592" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">cies] as well as for the viewers abroad. The orders passed by the High Court in effect gave a right to</text>
<text top="607" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">DD to be the host broadcaster for telecasting in this country and for the TWI, for telecasting for the</text>
<text top="623" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">viewers outside this country as well as those viewers in this country who have an access to the TWI</text>
<text top="638" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">frequency. The order was eminently in the interests of the viewers whatever its merits on the other</text>
<text top="654" left="72" width="104" height="12" font="0">aspects of the matter.</text>
<text top="684" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">123. The orders passed by the High Court have to be viewed against the backdrop of the events and</text>
<text top="700" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">the position of law discussed above. The circumstances in which the High Court passed the orders</text>
<text top="715" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">and the factual and legal considerations which weighed with it in passing them speak for</text>

<text top="68" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">legality or otherwise of the orders has become academic and it is not necessary to pronounce our</text>
<text top="84" left="72" width="291" height="12" font="0">formal verdict on the same. Hence we refrain from doing so.</text>
<text top="115" left="72" width="170" height="12" font="0">124. We, therefore, hold as follows:</text>

<text top="161" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">a public authority in the interests of the public and to prevent the invasion of their rights. Since the</text>
<text top="176" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">electronic media involves the use of the airwaves, this factor creates an in- built restriction on its use</text>
<text top="192" left="72" width="205" height="12" font="0">as in the case of any other public property.</text>
<text top="222" left="72" width="379" height="12" font="0">[ii] The right to impart and receive information is a species of the right of free-</text>
<text top="253" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">the best means of imparting and receiving information and as such to have an access to telecasting</text>
<text top="269" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">for the purpose. However, this right to have an access to telecasting has limitations on account of the</text>
<text top="284" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">use of the public property, viz., the airwaves, involved in the exercise of the right and can be</text>
<text top="299" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">controlled and regulated by the public authority. This limitation imposed by the nature of the public</text>
<text top="315" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">property involved in the use of the electronic media is in addition to the restrictions imposed on the</text>
<text top="330" left="72" width="397" height="12" font="0">right to freedom of speech and expression under Article 19 [2] of the Constitution.</text>

<text top="68" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">popular game in India. It has acquired tremendous mass appeal. Television has brought the game</text>
<text top="84" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">into the hearths and homes of millions of citizens across the country, enhancing its appeal</text>
<text top="99" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">several-fold. Men, women and children who had no interest in the game earlier have now become its</text>
<text top="115" left="72" width="55" height="12" font="0">ardent fans</text>
<text top="145" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">- all because of its broadcast by radio and television. This has also attracted the attention of business</text>
<text top="161" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">and commerce. They see an excellent opportunity of advertising their products and wares. They are</text>
<text top="176" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">prepared to pay huge amounts therefor. The cricket clubs which conduct these cricket matches have</text>
<text top="192" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">come to see an enormous opportunity of making money through these matches. Previously, their</text>
<text top="207" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">income depended mainly upon the ticket money. Now, it probably does not count at all. The real</text>
<text top="222" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">income comes from the advertisements both in-stadia as well as the spot advertisements over radio</text>
<text top="238" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">and television. The value of in- stadia advertisement has increased enormously on account of its</text>
<text top="253" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">constant exposure on television during the progress of the game. Lured by this huge revenues,</text>
<text top="269" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">organisers of these events now propose to sell the broadcasting rights used compendiously to denote</text>
<text top="284" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">both radio and television rights - of these events to the highest bidder, be he foreign agency or a</text>
<text top="299" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">local one. They find that Doordarshan is not in a position to or willing to pay as much as the foreign</text>
<text top="315" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">agencies are. Accordingly, they have sold these rights to foreign agencies. But - and here lies the rub</text>
<text top="330" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">- broadcasting the event, particularly telecasting, requires import, installation and operation of</text>
<text top="346" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">certain equipment by these foreign agencies for which the law (Indian Telegraph Act) requires a</text>
<text top="361" left="72" width="124" height="12" font="0">prior permission - licence</text>
<text top="392" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">- to be granted by Government of India. Earlier, they wanted uplinking facility too through Videsh</text>
<text top="407" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">Sanchar Nigam Ltd., a Government of India-owned company. Now they suggest, it may not be</text>
<text top="423" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">necessary. They say, they can uplink directly from their earth station installed, or parked, as the case</text>
<text top="438" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">may be, near the playing field to their designated communication satellite which will beam it back to</text>

<text top="515" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">has helped it popularise. So also is the plea of All India Radio (AIR). They are Government agencies</text>
<text top="530" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">- departments of Government. AIR and Doordarshan enjoy a monopoly in this country in the matter</text>
<text top="546" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">of broadcasting and telecasting. They cannot think of any other agency doing the same job. They are</text>
<text top="561" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">not prepared to reconcile themselves to any other agency, more particularly, a foreign agency being</text>
<text top="577" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">invited to broadcast/ telecast these events and they themselves being asked to negotiate and</text>
<text top="592" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">purchase these rights from such foreign agencies. They say, they alone should be allowed to telecast</text>
<text top="607" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">and broadcast these events; that they alone must act as the 'host broadcaster', which means they</text>
<text top="623" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">alone shall generate the host broadcasting signal, which the interested foreign agencies can</text>

<text top="469" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">participate in the first instance. The Hero Cup Tournament comprised several one day matches and</text>
<text top="484" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">its attraction was not confined to India but to all the cricket loving countries which, in effect, means</text>
<text top="500" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">all the commonwealth countries. The tournament was to be held during the month of November,</text>
<text top="515" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">1993. Until 1993, Doordarshan was acting as the host broadcaster in respect of all the cricket</text>
<text top="530" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">matches played in India. It generated the 'host broadcaster signal', which signal could be assigned or</text>
<text top="546" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">sold to foreign television organisations for being broadcast in their countries. However, an exception</text>
<text top="561" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">was made by the Government of India - for reasons we do not know - in respect of an earlier</text>
<text top="577" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">tournament; a foreign agency was permitted to telecast the matches in addition to Doordarshan.</text>
<text top="592" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">This exception appears to have set a precedent. On March 15, 1993 the Cricket Association of Bengal</text>

<text top="269" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">called upon Doordarshan to let them know whether Doordarshan is in the deal and if so to submit</text>
<text top="284" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">its detailed offer for worldwide TV rights by May 17, 1993. The Doordarshan was given an option</text>

<text top="315" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">Even before receiving this letter of CAB dated May 12, 1993, Doordarshan addressed a letter to CAB</text>

<text top="376" left="72" width="363" height="12" font="0">authorities, allegedly under the instructions of the Ministry of Telecommu-</text>

<text top="423" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">that all the governmental authorities including the customs authorities shall act in accordance with</text>
<text top="438" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">the interim orders dated 8/9th November, 1993. Meanwhile, it appears, certain individuals claiming</text>
<text top="453" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">to be interested in watching cricket matches on television filed independent writ petitions for a</text>
<text top="469" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">direction to the Doordarshan to telecast the matches. The learned Judge expressed the opinion that</text>
<text top="484" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">by their internal fight between Respondents 1 to 5 on one hand and Respondent No.6 (reference is</text>
<text top="500" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">to the ranking in the writ petition) on the other, millions of viewers in India are deprived of the</text>
<text top="515" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">pleasure of watching the matches on television. He then referred to the representation that at the</text>
<text top="530" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">instance of Doordarshan and others, All-India Radio (AIR) too has stopped broadcasting the</text>
<text top="546" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">matches. The learned Judge observed that there is no reason for AIR to do so and accordingly</text>
<text top="561" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">directed the Union of India and others including the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting to</text>
<text top="577" left="72" width="272" height="12" font="0">broadcast the remaining cricket matches on AIR as well.</text>
<text top="607" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">141. Aggrieved by the orders of the learned Single Judge aforementioned, the Union of India and</text>

<text top="638" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">for orders on November 12, 1993 before a Division Bench of the Calcutta High Court. It was</text>
<text top="654" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">submitted by the learned counsel for the Union of India that though the Doordarshan is very much</text>
<text top="669" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">keen to telecast the matches, the CAB has really created problems by entering into an agreement</text>
<text top="684" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">with TWI. He submitted that under Section 4 of the Telegraph Act, 1885, the Central Government</text>
<text top="700" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">has the exclusive provilege of establishing, maintaining and working telegraph and that the</text>

<text top="84" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">After referring to the rival contentions of the parties and the correspondence that passed between</text>
<text top="99" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">them, the Division Bench observed that there were two dimensions to the problem arising before</text>
<text top="115" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">them, viz., (i) the right to telecast by Doordarshan within India and (2) right of TWI to telecast</text>

<text top="145" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">going into the merits of the rival contentions, and keeping in view the interest of millions of viewers,</text>
<text top="161" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">the Division Bench observed: &#34;we record, as Doordarshan is inclined to telecast the matches for the</text>
<text top="176" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">Indian viewers on receipt of Rs.5 lakhs per match and to enjoy the exclusive right of signalling</text>
<text top="192" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">within the country being the host broadcaster, we direct the CAB to pay immediately a sum of Rs.5</text>

<text top="222" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">otherwise in respect of 28 minutes which is available for commercial purpose be realised by the</text>

<text top="253" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">dealt with and dispose of the said amount until further orders&#34; to be passed in the said writ appeal.</text>
<text top="269" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">The Doordarshan was accordingly directed to immediately start telecasting the matches. The Bench</text>
<text top="284" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">then took up the question whether TWI is entitled to telecast the matches from Indian territory. It</text>
<text top="299" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">noted that no formal order as required under the proviso to Section 4(1)  of the Telegraph Act has</text>
<text top="315" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">been granted in favour of either CAB or TWI. Purporting to take notice of the national and</text>
<text top="330" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">international impact of the issue, the Bench directed the 5th appellant before them, viz.., the</text>

<text top="376" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">permission, shall grant a provisional permission or licence without prejudice to the rights and</text>
<text top="392" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">contentions of the parties in this appeal and the writ application and subject to the condition that</text>

<text top="500" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">142. On November 14, 1993, the matter was again taken up by the Division Bench, on being</text>
<text top="515" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">mentioned by the parties. The first problem placed before the Bench was placement of cameras. The</text>
<text top="530" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">Doordarshan authorities complained that they have not been given suitable place for the purpose of</text>
<text top="546" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">telecasting. Doordarshan further submitted that there can only be one signalling from the field and</text>
<text top="561" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">that in terms of the orders of the Division Bench, Doordarshan should be the host broadcaster and</text>
<text top="577" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">TWI should take the signal from Doordarshan. This request was opposed by the CAB and TWI. The</text>
<text top="592" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">Bench directed that according to their earlier order the TWI is entitled to telecast outside the</text>
<text top="607" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">country and to send their signal accordingly and in case the signalling is required to be made by TWI</text>
<text top="623" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">separately, the necessary permission should be given by the Doordarshan and other competent</text>

<text top="99" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">detained by customs authorities at Bombay. On November 15, 1993, this court directed the</text>

<text top="253" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">on that very day. This court stayed the said order to the extent it imposed a condition that TWI will</text>
<text top="269" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">get their signal from Doordarshan for uplinking through VSNL. The TWI was permitted to generate</text>
<text top="284" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">their own signal by focussing their cameras on the ground. It was observed that the said order shall</text>
<text top="299" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">not be treated as a precedent in future since it was made in the particular facts and circumstances of</text>

<text top="376" left="72" width="336" height="12" font="0">development took place in 1994 which now requires to be mentioned.</text>
<text top="407" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">146. In connection with World Cup Matches scheduled for the year 1996, certain correspondence</text>
<text top="423" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">took place between Doordarshan and the Board of Cricket Control, India (BCCI). While the said</text>
<text top="438" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">correspondence was in progress, each side re- affirming their respective stand, BCCI arranged</text>
<text top="453" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">certain international cricket matches to be played between the national teams of India, West Indies</text>
<text top="469" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">and New Zealand during the months of October-December, 1994. BCCI entered into an agreement</text>
<text top="484" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">with ESPN, a foreign agency, for telecasting all the cricket matches organised by BCCI in India for</text>
<text top="500" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">the next five years for a consideration of US $30 million. Doordarshan was totally excluded. ESPN</text>
<text top="515" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">in turn made an offer to Doordarshan to purchase the right to telecast the matches in India from</text>
<text top="530" left="72" width="332" height="12" font="0">ESPN at a particular consideration which the Doordarshan declined.</text>
<text top="561" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">147. On September 20, 1994, we commenced the hearing of these matters. While the hearing was in</text>

<text top="145" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">148. The CAB and BCCI have taken a common stand, were represented by the same counsel and</text>
<text top="161" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">have also filed common written submissions. It is not possible to reproduce all their contentions as</text>
<text top="176" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">put forward in their written submissions because of the number of pages they run into. It would</text>
<text top="192" left="72" width="268" height="12" font="0">suffice if I set out their substance. The submissions are:</text>
<text top="222" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">(a) CAB and BCCI are non-profit-making sporting organisations devoted to the promotion of cricket</text>
<text top="238" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">and its ideals. They organise international cricket tournaments and series from time to time which</text>
<text top="253" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">call for not only good amount of Organisation but substantial expense. Payments have to be made to</text>
<text top="269" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">the members of the teams participating. Considerable amount of money has to be expended on the</text>
<text top="284" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">training of players and providing infrastructural facilities in India. All this requires funds which</text>
<text top="299" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">have to be raised by these organisations on their own. Accordingly, CAB entered into an agreement</text>
<text top="315" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">with TWI for telecasting the Hero Cup Tournament matches to be played in the year 1993. The</text>
<text top="330" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">necessary permissions were applied for and granted by the Ministries of Home, Defence, Human</text>
<text top="346" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">Resource Development and Telecommunications. The Ministry of Telecommunications/VSNL</text>
<text top="361" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">accepted the monies for the purpose of providing uplinking facilities, which does amount to implied</text>
<text top="376" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">grant of permission under the proviso to Section 4(1) of the Telegraph Act. In any event, the</text>
<text top="392" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">acceptance of the monies made it obligatory upon the ministries to grant the said licence. It is only</text>
<text top="407" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">on account of the interference and lobbying by Doordarshan and Ministry of Information and</text>
<text top="423" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">Broadcasting that the other ministries went back and refused to permit the telecast. The action of</text>
<text top="438" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">the Doordarshan and the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting is malafide, unreasonable and</text>
<text top="453" left="72" width="168" height="12" font="0">authoritarian besides being illegal.</text>
<text top="484" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">(b) The game of cricket provides entertainment to public. It Is a form of expression and is, therefore,</text>
<text top="500" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">included within the freedom of speech and expression guaranteed by Article 19(1)(a) of the</text>
<text top="515" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">Constitution. This right includes the right to telecast and broadcast the matches. This right belongs</text>
<text top="530" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">to the organiser of the matches which cannot be interfered with by anyone. The organiser is free to</text>
<text top="546" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">choose such agency as it thinks appropriate for telecasting and broadcasting its matches. The</text>
<text top="561" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">Doordarshan or the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting can claim no right whatsoever to</text>
<text top="577" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">telecast or broadcast the said matches. If they wish to do so, they must negotiate with the organiser</text>
<text top="592" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">and obtain the right. They have no inherent right, much less a monopoly, in the matter of telecasting</text>
<text top="607" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">and broadcasting these matches. It is not their events. If the organisers, CAB and BCCI herein,</text>
<text top="623" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">choose to entrust the said rights to a foreign agency, such foreign agency is merely an agency of the</text>
<text top="638" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">organisers and the mere fact that it happens to be a foreign agency is no ground for depriving the</text>
<text top="654" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">organisers, who as Indian citizens, are entitled to the fundamental right guaranteed by Article</text>
<text top="669" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">19(1)(a). The said right can be restricted or regulated only by a law made with reference to the</text>

<text top="68" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">19(1)(a). So read and understood, it is only a regulatory provision. If a person applies for a licence</text>

<text top="99" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">appropriate authority is bound to grant such licence unless it can seek refuge under a law made in</text>
<text top="115" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">terms of clause (2) of Article 19. The appropriate authority cannot also impose such conditions as</text>
<text top="130" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">would nullify or defeat the guaranteed freedom. The conditions to be imposed should be reasonable</text>
<text top="145" left="72" width="123" height="12" font="0">and relevant to the grant.</text>
<text top="176" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">(d) Doordarshan or AIR has no monopoly in the matter of telecasting/broadcasting. Radio and</text>
<text top="192" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">television are only a medium through which freedom of speech and expression is expressed. Article</text>
<text top="207" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">19(2) does not permit any monopoly as does clause (6) in the matter of Article 19(1)(g). Section 4,</text>
<text top="222" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">which contemplates grant of telegraph licences is itself destructive of the claim of monopoly by</text>

<text top="269" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">(e) Right to disseminate and receive information is a part of the right guaranteed by Article 19(1)(a).</text>
<text top="284" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">Televising the cricket match is a form of dissemination of information. The mere fact that the</text>
<text top="299" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">organisers earn some income from such activity does not make it anytheless a form of expression. It</text>
<text top="315" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">has been held repeatedly by this court in the matter of freedom of press that the mere fact that</text>
<text top="330" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">publication of newspaper has also certain business features is no ground to treat it as a business</text>
<text top="346" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">proposition and that it remains an activity relatable to Article 19(1)(a). Business activity is not the</text>
<text top="361" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">main but only an incidental activity of CAB/BCCI,. the main activity being promotion of cricket. It</text>
<text top="376" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">follows that whenever any citizen of this country seeks to exercise this right, all necessary</text>
<text top="392" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">permissions have to be granted by the appropriate authorities. The only ground upon which it can</text>
<text top="407" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">be refused is with reference to law made in the interest of one or the other ground mentioned in</text>
<text top="423" left="72" width="132" height="12" font="0">Article 19(2) and none else.</text>
<text top="453" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">(f) With the technological advance and the availability of a large number of frequencies and</text>
<text top="469" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">channels, being provided by the increasing number of satellites, the argument of limited frequencies</text>
<text top="484" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">and/or scarce resource is no longer tenable. The BCCI does not want allotment of frequency - not</text>
<text top="500" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">even the uplinking facility, since it has the facility to uplink directly from the earth station to</text>
<text top="515" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">Gorizon-Russian satellite with which ESPN has an arrangement All that the BCCI wants is a</text>
<text top="530" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">licence/permission for importing and operating the station, wherever the match is played. In such</text>
<text top="546" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">an eventuality, Doordarshan does not come into picture at all. Of course, in connection with Hero</text>
<text top="561" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">Cup matches, the CAB wanted uplinking facility for the reason that it wanted uplinking to</text>
<text top="577" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">INTELSAT, which is provided only through VSNL. If an organiser does not want uplinking to</text>
<text top="592" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">INTELSAT, he need not even approach VSNL. As a matter of fact, major networks in United States</text>

<text top="684" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">(i) The CAB or for that matter BCCI did not even apply for a licence under the proviso to Section 4(1)</text>
<text top="700" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">nor was such li- cence granted by the appropriate authority at any time or on any occasion. The</text>
<text top="715" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">grant of permission by other departments including the collection of fees by VSNL does not amount</text>

<text top="84" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">Indian territory. The argument of implied permission - or the alternate argument that the</text>
<text top="99" left="72" width="375" height="12" font="0">authorities were bound to grant such permission - is misconceived, more par-</text>
<text top="130" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">ticularly, in the absence of even an application for grant of licence under Section 4 of the Telegraph</text>
<text top="145" left="72" width="19" height="12" font="0">Act.</text>
<text top="176" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">(ii) The Calcutta High Court was not right in giving the directions it did. Particularly the direction</text>
<text top="192" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">given in its order dated November 12, 1993 to the Secretary, Ministry of Telecommunications,</text>
<text top="207" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">Government of India, was contrary to law. While directing the Secretary to consider the facts and</text>
<text top="222" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">circumstances of the case, the High Court expressly opined that there was already an implied grant</text>
<text top="238" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">of permis- sion. After expressing the said opinion, the direction to consider was a mere formality</text>
<text top="253" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">and of little significance. The charge of malafides and arbitrary and authoritarian conduct levelled</text>
<text top="269" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">against Doordarshan and the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting is wholly unfounded and</text>
<text top="284" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">unsustainable in the facts and circumstances of the case. In the absence of a licence under Section 4</text>
<text top="299" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">of the Telegraph Act, VSNL could not have granted uplinking facility and it is for that reason that the</text>
<text top="315" left="72" width="416" height="12" font="0">Department of Telecommunications wrote its letter dated November 3, 1993 to VSNL.</text>
<text top="346" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">(iii) Realising the lack of coordination among the various ministries concerned in granting</text>
<text top="361" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">permission in such a matter, the Government of India has since taken a policy decision in the</text>
<text top="376" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">meeting of the Committee of Secretaries held on November 12, 1993. It has been decided that</text>
<text top="392" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">satellite uplinking from the Indian soil should be within the exclusive competence of the Ministry of</text>
<text top="407" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">Information and Broadcasting/ Department of Space/Department of Tele- communications and</text>
<text top="423" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">that similarly the telecast of sports events shall be within the exclusive purview of the</text>
<text top="438" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">Doordarshan/Ministry of Information and Broadcasting who in turn could market their rights to</text>
<text top="453" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">other par-ties on occasion in whole or in part. It has been further decided that in respect of any such</text>
<text top="469" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">event, the organiser shall contact the specified nodal ministry which in turn will coordinate with all</text>
<text top="484" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">other concerned departments. In short, what may be called a 'single window system' has been</text>
<text top="500" left="72" width="325" height="12" font="0">evolved which is indeed in the interest of organisers of such events.</text>
<text top="530" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">(iv) So far as the contention based upon Article 19(1)(a) is concerned, the contentions of CAB/BCCI</text>
<text top="546" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">are misleading and over-simplistic. The right guaranteed by Article 19(1)(a) is not limited to</text>
<text top="561" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">organisers of such sports events. The said right is guaranteed equally to the broadcaster and the</text>
<text top="577" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">viewers. Among them, the right of the viewers is the more important one. The decisions rendered by</text>
<text top="592" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">this court in the matter of freedom of press are not strictly relevant in the matter of</text>
<text top="607" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">broadcast/telecast. Telecasting a sports event is distinct from the event itself It is evident that the</text>
<text top="623" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">CAB/ BCCI are seeking to earn as much as possible by selling the telecasting rights. It is nothing but</text>
<text top="638" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">commerce and an activity solely relatable to Article 19(1)(g) and not to Article 19(1)(a). Inviting bids</text>
<text top="654" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">from all over the world and selling the telecast rights to the highest bidder has nothing to do with</text>
<text top="669" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">Article 19(1)(a). In any event, the predominant element in such activity is that of business. The</text>
<text top="684" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">interest of general public is, therefore, a relevant consideration in such matters. The public interest</text>
<text top="700" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">demands that foreign agencies should not be freely permitted to come and set up their telecasting</text>
<text top="715" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">facilities in India in an unrestricted fashion. The occasion for inviting foreign agencies may possibly</text>

<text top="84" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">but the CAB and BCCI were more interested in deriving maximum profit from the event.</text>
<text top="99" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">Doordarshan cannot certainly compete with foreign agencies who are offering more money not</text>
<text top="115" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">merely for obtaining the right to telecast these events but with the real and ultimate object of</text>
<text top="130" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">gaining a foothold in the Indian telecasting scene. Through these events, the foreign telecasting</text>
<text top="145" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">organisations, particularly ESPN, are seeking entry into Indian market and it is for this reason that</text>
<text top="161" left="72" width="425" height="12" font="0">they are prepared to pay more. Their interest is something more than mere commercial.</text>
<text top="192" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">(v)The present situation is that the Doordarshan and AIR has got all the facilities of telecasting and</text>
<text top="207" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">broadcasting the events in India. They have been doing it for over the last several decades and they</text>
<text top="222" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">have the necessary infrastructure. The Doordarshan is taking all steps for updating its equipment</text>
<text top="238" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">and for training its technicians to handle the latest equipment. It is also entering into tic,-ups with</text>
<text top="253" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">certain foreign agencies for the purpose. They have always been prepared for any reasonable terms.</text>
<text top="269" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">Both Doordarshan and AIR are agencies of the State. Until recently, 97% of the telecasts made by</text>
<text top="284" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">Doordarshan did not earn any income. They only involved expense. Its income was derived mainly</text>
<text top="299" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">from the remaining three per cent of its activities including sports events like cricket. Recently, there</text>
<text top="315" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">has been a slight change in policy but the picture largely remains the same. There is nothing</text>
<text top="330" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">illegitimate or unreasonable in Doordarshan seeking to earn some money in the matter of telecast of</text>
<text top="346" left="72" width="59" height="12" font="0">such events.</text>
<text top="376" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">(vi)The very nature of television media is such that it necessarily involves the marshaling of the</text>
<text top="392" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">resource for the greatest public good. The state monopoly is created as a device to use the resource</text>
<text top="407" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">for public good. It is not violative of the right of free speech so long as the paramount interest of the</text>
<text top="423" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">viewers is subserved and access to media is governed by the 'fairness doctrine'. Section 4 of the</text>
<text top="438" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">Telegraph Act cannot be faulted on any ground. Indeed, in none of the petitions filed by the</text>

<text top="484" left="72" width="257" height="12" font="0">ANSWERS TO THE QUESTIONS QUESTION NO. 1:</text>
<text top="515" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">151. The facts narrated in Part-II show that neither CAB nor BCCI ever applied for a licence under</text>
<text top="530" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">the first proviso to sub-section (1) of Section 4 of the Telegraph Act. The permissions obtained from</text>
<text top="546" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">other departments, viz., from the Ministry of Human Resource, VSNL, Ministry of Home Affairs,</text>
<text top="561" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">Ministry of Finance or the Central Board of Excise and Customs cannot take the place of licence</text>
<text top="577" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">under Section 4(1). Indeed, this fact was recognised by the Division Bench of the Calcutta High</text>
<text top="592" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">Court and it is for the said reason that it directed the Secretary to the Telecom Department to decide</text>
<text top="607" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">the question whether such licence should be granted to CAB in connection with Hero Cup matches.</text>
<text top="623" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">But while directing the Secretary to consider the said question, it chose to make certain observations</text>
<text top="638" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">which had the effect of practically foreclosing the issue before the Secretary. The Division Bench</text>
<text top="654" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">observed that the Sec- retary should proceed on the assumption that there was an implied grant of</text>
<text top="669" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">permission. As a matter of fact, the Secretary was directed to grant the licence in so many words,</text>
<text top="684" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">thus leaving no discretion in him to examine the matter in accordance with law. It became an empty</text>
<text top="700" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">formality. I am of the opinion that while asking the Secre- tary to decide the issue under proviso to</text>
<text top="715" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">Section 4(1), his discretion and judgment could not have been restricted or forestalled in the above</text>

<text top="53" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">manner. Be that as it may, in pursuance of the said directions and the directions of this Court - the</text>
<text top="68" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">Secretary passed certain orders, the legality of which has now become academic for the reason that</text>
<text top="84" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">both the events, viz., the Hero Cup matches as well as the recent international matches (October-</text>
<text top="99" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">December, 1994) are over. The only thing that remains to be considered is whether the charge of</text>
<text top="115" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">malafides and arbitrary and authoritarian conducted attributed to the Doordarshan by CAB and</text>
<text top="130" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">BCCI is justified. Firstly neither the CAB nor its foreign agent had applied for or obtained the</text>
<text top="145" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">licence/permission under Section 4(1). The permissions granted by other departments are no</text>
<text top="161" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">substitute for the licence under the proviso to Section 4(1). 'Mere is nothing to show that seizure of</text>
<text top="176" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">imported equipment by customs authorities was at the instance of Doordarshan; it appears to be for</text>
<text top="192" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">non-compliance with the requirements subject to which permission to import was granted.</text>
<text top="207" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">Secondly, this issue, in my opinion, cannot be examined in isolation but must be judged in the light</text>
<text top="222" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">of the entire relevant context. The Doordarshan did enjoy monopoly of telecasting in India which is</text>
<text top="238" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">the product of and appears to be sustained by Section 4(1) of the Telegraph Act. There was no</text>
<text top="253" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">occasion when a foreign agency was allowed into India without the consent of or without reference</text>
<text top="269" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">to Doordarshan to telecast such events. All these years, it was Doordarshan which was telecasting</text>
<text top="284" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">these matches. On one previous occasion, a foreign agency was allowed but that was by the</text>
<text top="299" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">Doordarshan itself or at any rate with the consent of and in cooperation with the Doordarshan. It is</text>
<text top="315" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">for this reason that the Doordarshan was asserting its exclusive right to telecast the event taking</text>
<text top="330" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">place on Indian soil and was not prepared to purchase the said right from a foreign agency to whom</text>
<text top="346" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">the CAB and BCCI sold all their rights. It is also worth noticing that neither CAB nor BCCI or for</text>
<text top="361" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">that matter any other sports organisation had ever before invited a foreign agency to telecast or</text>
<text top="376" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">broadcast their events - at any rate, not without the consent of Doordarshan. The agreement with</text>
<text top="392" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">TWI entered into by CAB and the agreement with ESPN entered into by the BCCI were unusual and</text>
<text top="407" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">new developments for all concerned. Like the bureaucracy everywhere, the Indian bureaucracy is</text>
<text top="423" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">also perhaps slow in adjusting to the emerging realities, more particularly when they see a threat to</text>
<text top="438" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">their power and authority in such developments. In the circumstances, their objection to a foreign</text>
<text top="453" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">agency coming in and telecasting such events without even obtaining a licence under the proviso to</text>
<text top="469" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">Section 4(1) of the Telegraph Act cannot be termed malafide or arbitrary. So far as the charge of</text>
<text top="484" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">authoritarianism is concerned, it is equally unsustainable for the reason that the CAB/ BCCI had no</text>
<text top="500" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">legal right nor any justification in insisting upon telecasting their events through foreign agencies</text>
<text top="515" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">without even applying for and/or obtaining a licence required by law. The correspondence between</text>
<text top="530" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">them shows that each was trying to get the better of the other; it was like a game of fencing. In my</text>
<text top="546" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">opinion, therefore, the charge of malafides or for that matter, the charge of arbitrary or</text>
<text top="561" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">authoritarian conduct levelled against the Doordarshan and/or other governmental authorities is</text>

<text top="207" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">It must be said at once that this may indeed be the first decision in this country, when such an</text>

<text top="238" left="72" width="457" height="12" font="0">the European Court of Human Rights, with varying results as we shall indicate in a little while.</text>
<text top="269" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">153. There may be no difficulty in agreeing that a game of cricket like any other sports event</text>
<text top="284" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">provides entertainment - and entertainment is a facet, a part, of free speech. [See Burstyn v. Wilson</text>
<text top="299" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">(96 L.Ed.1098)], subject to the caveat that where speech and conduct are joined in a single course of</text>
<text top="315" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">action, the free speech values must be balanced against competing societal interests. [Los Angeles v.</text>
<text top="330" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">Preferred Communications (1986 - 476 U.S.488 = 90 L.Ed.2d.480)]. It attracts a large audience. But</text>
<text top="346" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">the question is whether the organiser of the event can say that his freedom of expression takes in the</text>
<text top="361" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">right to telecast it from the Indian soil without any restrictions or regulations. The argument really</text>
<text top="376" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">means this, I have a right to propagate my expression, viz., the game, by such means as I think</text>
<text top="392" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">appropriate, I may choose to have a television station of my own or I may invite a foreign agency to</text>
<text top="407" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">do the job. Whatever I wish, the State must provide to enable me to propagate my game. I may make</text>
<text top="423" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">money in the process but that is immaterial'. In effect, this is an assertion of an absolute and</text>
<text top="438" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">unrestricted right to establish private radio and television stations, since there is no distinction in</text>
<text top="453" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">principle between having a mobile earth station (which beams its programmes to a satellite via</text>
<text top="469" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">VSNL or directly to another satellite which in turn beams it back to earth) and a stationary television</text>
<text top="484" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">station. Similarly, there is no distinction in law between a permanent telecasting facility and a</text>
<text top="500" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">facility for a given occasion. Question is, is such a stand acceptable within the framework of our</text>
<text top="515" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">Constitution? (The question relating to interpretation of Section 4(1), 1 will deal with it separately.) I</text>
<text top="530" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">may clarify that I am concerned herein with 'live telecast' which requires the telecast equipment to</text>
<text top="546" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">be placed at or near the field where the event is taking place, i.e., telecasting from the Indian</text>
<text top="561" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">territory. This clarification is appended in view of the contention urged that nothing prevents the</text>
<text top="577" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">organisers - 1 or for that matter, anybody - from video recording the event and then take the video</text>
<text top="592" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">cassette out of this country and telecast it from outside stations. Undoubtedly, they can do so. Only</text>
<text top="607" left="72" width="456" height="12" font="0">thing is that it will not be a live telecast and it would also not be a telecast from the Indian soil.</text>

<text top="222" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">merely to a few. No one can exercise his right of speech in such a manner as to violate another man's</text>
<text top="238" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">right of speech. One man's right to speak ends where the other man's right to speak begins. Indeed,</text>
<text top="253" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">it may be the duty of the State to ensure that this right is available to all in equal measure and that it</text>
<text top="269" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">is not hijacked by a few to the detriment of the rest. This obligation flows from the preamble to our</text>
<text top="284" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">Constitution, which seeks to secure. to all its citizens liberty of thought, expression, belief and</text>
<text top="299" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">worship. State being a product of the Constitution is as much committed to this goal as any citizen of</text>
<text top="315" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">this country. Indeed, this obliga- tion also flows from the injunction in Article 14 that &#34;the State shall</text>
<text top="330" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">not deny to any person equality before the law&#34; and the direction in Article 38(2) to the effect: &#34;the</text>

<text top="376" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">scheme, the State is not merely under an obligation to respect the fundamental rights guaranteed by</text>
<text top="392" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">Part-III but under an equal obligation to ensure conditions in which those rights can be</text>

<text top="453" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">of decisions and it is unnecessary to burden this judgment with those decisions. Freedom of speech</text>
<text top="469" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">and expression, it has been held repeatedly, is basic to and indivisible from a democratic polity. It</text>
<text top="484" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">encompasses freedom of press. It includes right to impart and receive information. The question</text>
<text top="500" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">now in issue is: does it include the freedom to broadcast and telecast one's views, ideas and opinions</text>
<text top="515" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">and whether, if one wishes to do so, is the State bound to provide all necessary licences, permits and</text>
<text top="530" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">facilities therefor? This requires an examination of the history of broadcasting and telecasting in this</text>
<text top="546" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">country as well as in certain leading democracies in the world. In this judgment, the expression</text>

<text top="222" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">was critical of government, it was held, Doordarshan cannot refuse to telecast it. It was pointed out</text>
<text top="238" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">pertinently that the refusal to telecast was not based upon the ground that the list of award-winning</text>

<text top="84" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">163. The history of broadcasting in United States and other European countries has been basically</text>
<text top="99" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">different, perhaps because of historical factors besides constitutional principles. In the United</text>
<text top="115" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">States, courts have regarded freedom of speech almost entirely as a liberty against the State, while</text>
<text top="130" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">the constitutional courts in Europe have looked upon it as a value which may sometimes compel the</text>
<text top="145" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">government to act to ensure the right. Constitutions of most of the countries in western Europe, e.g</text>
<text top="161" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">Germany, Italy and France are of post World War-II vintage whereas the First Amendment to the</text>
<text top="176" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">United States Constitution is more than 200 years old. These modem European Constitutions cast</text>
<text top="192" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">an obligation upon their governments to promote broadcasting freedom and not merely to refrain</text>
<text top="207" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">from interfering with it. The Constitution of Germany expressly refers to the right to broadcast as</text>
<text top="222" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">part of freedom of speech and expression. So far as the United Kingdom is concerned, the</text>
<text top="238" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">development there has to be understood in the context of its peculiar constitutional history coupled</text>
<text top="253" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">with the fact that it has no written constitution. Even so, freedom of thought and expression has</text>
<text top="269" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">been an abiding faith with that nation. It has been a refuge for non-conformists and radical thinkers</text>
<text top="284" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">all over the world - a fact, which does not beg any proof And yet broadcasting in all these countries</text>
<text top="299" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">was a State or a public monopoly to start with. Only much later have these countries started</text>
<text top="315" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">licensing private broadcasting stations. The main catalyst for this development has been Article 10</text>
<text top="330" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">of the European Convention on Human Rights which guarantees freedom of expression to all the</text>
<text top="346" left="72" width="417" height="12" font="0">citizens of the member countries and refers specifically to radio and television. It says:</text>
<text top="376" left="108" width="415" height="12" font="0">&#34;10(1) Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include</text>
<text top="392" left="108" width="415" height="12" font="0">freedom to hold opinions and to receive and import information and ideas without</text>
<text top="407" left="108" width="415" height="12" font="0">interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers. This Article shall not</text>
<text top="423" left="108" width="415" height="12" font="0">prevent States from requiring the licensing of broadcasting, television or cinema</text>
<text top="438" left="108" width="415" height="12" font="0">enterprises. (2)The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and</text>
<text top="453" left="108" width="415" height="12" font="0">responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or</text>
<text top="469" left="108" width="415" height="12" font="0">penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the</text>

<text top="453" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">as Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA). In 1984, IBA acquired powers in respect of direct</text>

<text top="330" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">a State monopoly. The government exercised tight control over the radio. An ordinance issued in</text>

<text top="561" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">broadcasting was upheld by Conseil constitutionnel (Constitutional Court) in 1978. In 1982,</text>
<text top="577" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">however, a significant change took place. The State recognised the right of citizens to have a &#34;free</text>

<text top="269" left="108" width="415" height="12" font="0">speech'.&#34; The regulations are a reasonable means of promoting the public interest in</text>
<text top="284" left="108" width="415" height="12" font="0">diversified mass communications; thus they do not violate the First Amendment</text>
<text top="299" left="108" width="343" height="12" font="0">rights of those who will be denied broadcast licenses pursuant to them.</text>
<text top="330" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">175. It is significant to notice the statement that &#34;to deny a station licence because 'the public</text>
<text top="346" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">interest' requires it 'is not a denial of free speech&#34;' - a holding to which we shall have occasion to</text>

<text top="392" left="108" width="415" height="12" font="0">*** As far back as 1948, the Court held in US v. Paramount Pictures (92 L. Ed. 126 1)</text>

<text top="269" left="72" width="266" height="12" font="0">BROADCASTING FREEDOM Meaning and content of.</text>
<text top="299" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">179. There is little doubt that broadcasting freedom is implicit in the freedom of speech and</text>
<text top="315" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">expression. The European Court of Human Rights also has taken the view that broadcasting like</text>
<text top="330" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">press is covered by Article 10 of the Convention guaranteeing the right to freedom of expression. But</text>
<text top="346" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">the question is what does broadcasting freedom mean? Broadly speaking, broadcasting freedom can</text>
<text top="361" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">be said to have four facets, (a) freedom of the broadcaster, (b) freedom of the listeners/viewers to a</text>
<text top="376" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">variety of view and plurality of opinion, (c) right of the citizens and groups of citizens to have access</text>
<text top="392" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">to the broadcasting media, and (d) the right to establish private radio/TV stations. We shall examine</text>
<text top="407" left="72" width="134" height="12" font="0">them under separate heads.</text>
<text top="438" left="72" width="202" height="12" font="0">(a) FREEDOM OF THE BROADCASTER:</text>
<text top="469" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">180. The first facet of the broadcasting freedom is freedom from State or Governmental control, in</text>
<text top="484" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">particular from the censorship by the Government. As the Peacock Committee put it,</text>
<text top="500" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">pre-publication censorship has no place in a free society. Pre-publication censorship is prohibited in</text>
<text top="515" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">Ger- many by Article 5 of the Basic Law. This principle applies in equal measure both to public and</text>
<text top="530" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">private broadcasting. It is, however, necessary to clarify here that public broadcasting is not to be</text>
<text top="546" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">equated with State broadcasting. Both are distinct. Broadcasting freedom in the case of pub- lic</text>
<text top="561" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">broadcasting means the composition of these bodies in a manner so as to genuinely guarantee their</text>
<text top="577" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">independence. In Germany, the Constitutional Court has ruled that freedom from State control</text>
<text top="592" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">requires the legislature to frame some basic rules to ensure that Government is unable to exercise</text>
<text top="607" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">any influence over the selection, content or scheduling of programmes. Laws providing to the</text>
<text top="623" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">contrary were held bad. Indeed, the court also enunciated certain guidelines for the composition and</text>
<text top="638" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">selection of the independent broadcasting authorities on the ground that such a course is necessary</text>
<text top="654" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">to ensure freedom from Government control. It should be noted that an unfettered freedom for</text>
<text top="669" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">licensees to select which programmes appear on their schedule to the complete disregard of the</text>
<text top="684" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">interests of public appears more like a property right than an attribute of freedom of speech. It is for</text>
<text top="700" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">this reason that the German constitutional court opined in 1981 (57 BVerfGE 295) and in 1987 (73</text>

<text top="68" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">speech in the in- terest of both broadcasters and the public. The court opined that broadcasting</text>
<text top="84" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">freedom is to be protected insofar as it's exercise promotes the goals of free speech, i.e., an informed</text>
<text top="99" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">democracy and lively discussion of a variety of views. The freedom of broadcaster cannot be</text>
<text top="115" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">understood as merely an immunity from government intervention but must be understood as a</text>
<text top="130" left="72" width="199" height="12" font="0">freedom to safeguard free speech right of</text>
<text top="161" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">-all the people without being dominated either by the State or any commercial group. This is also the</text>
<text top="176" left="72" width="213" height="12" font="0">view taken by the Italian and French courts.</text>
<text top="207" left="72" width="175" height="12" font="0">(b) LISTENERS/VIEWERS RIGHT.</text>
<text top="238" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">181. Broadcasting freedom involves and includes the right of the viewers and listeners who retain</text>
<text top="253" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">their interest in free speech. It is on this basis that the European courts have taken the view that</text>
<text top="269" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">restraints on freedom of broadcasters are justifiable on the very ground of free speech. It has been</text>
<text top="284" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">held that freedom of expression includes the right to receive information and ideas as well as</text>
<text top="299" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">freedom to impart them. &#34;The free speech interests of viewers and listeners in exposure to a wide</text>
<text top="315" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">variety of material can best be safe- guarded by the imposition of programme standards, limiting the</text>
<text top="330" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">freedom of radio and television companies. What is important according to this perspective is that</text>
<text top="346" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">the broadcasting institutions are free to discharge their responsibilities of providing the public with</text>
<text top="361" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">a balanced range of programmes and a variety of views. These free speech goals require positive</text>
<text top="376" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">legislative provision to prevent the domination of the broadcasting authorities by the government or</text>
<text top="392" left="72" width="400" height="12" font="0">by private corporations and advertisers, and perhaps for securing impartiality........</text>
<text top="423" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">182. The Fairness Doctrine evolved by FCC and approved by the United States Supreme Court in</text>
<text top="438" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">Red Lion protected the interest of persons by providing a right of reply to personal attacks. But</text>
<text top="453" left="72" width="453" height="12" font="0">difficulties have arisen in the matter of enforcing the listeners'/viewers' rights through courts.</text>
<text top="484" left="72" width="168" height="12" font="0">(c) ACCESS TO BROADCASTING:</text>
<text top="515" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">183. The third facet of broadcasting freedom is the freedom of individuals and groups of individuals</text>
<text top="530" left="72" width="289" height="12" font="0">to have access to broadcasting media to express their views.</text>
<text top="561" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">The first argument in support of this theory is that public is entitled to hear range of opinions held</text>
<text top="577" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">by different groups so that it can make sensible choices on political and social issues. In particular,</text>
<text top="592" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">these views should be exposed on television, the most important contemporary medium. It is indeed</text>
<text top="607" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">the interest of audience that justified the imposition of impartiality rules and positive programme</text>
<text top="623" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">standards upon the broadcasters. The theoretical foundation for the claim for access to broadcasting</text>
<text top="638" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">is that freedom of speech means the freedom to communicate effectively to a mass audience which</text>
<text top="654" left="72" width="432" height="12" font="0">means through mass media. This is also the view taken by our court as pointed out supra.</text>
<text top="684" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">184. An important decision on this as'pect is that of the United States Supreme Court in Columbia</text>
<text top="700" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">Broadcasting System v. Democratic National Committee [412 US 94 (1973)]. The CBS denied to</text>
<text top="715" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">Democrats and a group campaigning for peace in Vietnam any advertising time to comment upon</text>

<text top="68" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">Court of Appeals ruled that an absolute ban on short pre-paid editorial advertisements infringed the</text>
<text top="84" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">First Amendment and constituted impermissible discrimination. The Supreme Court, however,</text>
<text top="99" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">allowed the plea of CBS holding that recognition of a right of access of citizens and groups would be</text>
<text top="115" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">inconsistent with the broadcasters' freedom. They observed that if such right were to be recognised,</text>
<text top="130" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">wealthy individuals and pressure groups would have greater opportunities to purchase advertising</text>
<text top="145" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">time. It rejected the &#34;view that every potential speaker is 'the best judge of what the listening public</text>
<text top="161" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">ought to hear &#34;. (Burger,C.J.) Some Judges expressed the opinion that the broadcaster enjoyed the</text>
<text top="176" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">same First Amendment rights as the newspapers whereas the minority represented by Brennan and</text>
<text top="192" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">Marshall,JJ. was of the view that freedom of groups and individuals to effective expression justified</text>
<text top="207" left="72" width="274" height="12" font="0">recognition of some access rights to radio and television.</text>
<text top="238" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">185. It appears that this aspect has been debated more intensively in Italy. The Italian constitutional</text>
<text top="253" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">court held that the monopoly of RAI can be justified only on certain conditions, one of them being</text>
<text top="269" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">that access must be allowed so far as possible to the political, religious and social groups,</text>
<text top="284" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">representing various strands of opinion in society. It opined that statutory provision for access was</text>
<text top="299" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">required by Article 21 of the Constitution guaranteeing freedom of expression. The Italian courts</text>
<text top="315" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">viewed access as a goal or a policy rather than a matter- of fundamental right while at the same time</text>
<text top="330" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">protecting the individual's right of reply. On this aspect, Barendt says: There are also practical</text>
<text top="346" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">objections to access rights. It may be very difficult to decide, for example, which group are to be</text>
<text top="361" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">given access, and when and how often such programmes are shown. There is a danger some groups</text>
<text top="376" left="72" width="143" height="12" font="0">will be unduly privileged........</text>
<text top="407" left="72" width="363" height="12" font="0">(d)THE RIGHTS TO ESTABLISH PRIVATE BROADCASTING STATIONS:</text>
<text top="438" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">186. The French Broadcasting Laws of 1982 and 1989 limit the right of citizens to establish private</text>
<text top="453" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">broadcasting stations in the light of the necessity to respect individual rights, to safeguard pluralism</text>
<text top="469" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">of opinion and to protect public interests such as national security and public order. No private</text>
<text top="484" left="72" width="163" height="12" font="0">radio or television channel or sta-</text>
<text top="515" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">tion can be established without prior authorisation from the regulatory body, Conseil superieur de</text>
<text top="530" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">l'audiovisuel. In Britain, the ITC and the Radio Authority must grant the necessary licence for</text>
<text top="546" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">establishing a private television or radio station. In none of the European countries is there an</text>
<text top="561" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">unregulated right to establish private radio/television station. It is governed by law. Even in United</text>
<text top="577" left="72" width="182" height="12" font="0">States, it requires a licence from FCC.</text>
<text top="607" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">187. Let us examine the position obtaining in Italy and Germany where constitutional provisions</text>
<text top="623" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">corresponding to Article 19(1)(a) - indeed more explicit in the case of Germany - obtain.</text>
<text top="638" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">Notwithstanding Article 21, referred to hereinbefore, the Italian Constitutional Court continues to</text>
<text top="654" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">hold that public monopoly of broadcasting is justified, atleast at national level till adequate</text>
<text top="669" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">anti-trust laws are enacted to prevent the development of private media oli- gopolies. In fact, this</text>
<text top="684" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">principle has been applied in the case of local broadcasting and private broadcasting allowed at local</text>
<text top="700" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">level. The Italian Constitutional Court is of the view that Article 21 of the Italian Constitution does</text>

<text top="84" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">More particularly, it is of the view that it is impossible to justify recognition of a right which only a</text>

<text top="269" left="108" width="415" height="12" font="0">concentration of control of media that results from the only newspaper's being owned</text>
<text top="284" left="108" width="415" height="12" font="0">by the same interests which own a television station and a radio station, are</text>
<text top="299" left="108" width="415" height="12" font="0">important components of this trend towards concentration of control of outlets to</text>

<text top="346" left="108" width="415" height="12" font="0">The result of these vast changes has been to place in a few hands the power to inform</text>
<text top="361" left="108" width="415" height="12" font="0">the American people and shape public opinion. Much of the editorial opinion and</text>
<text top="376" left="108" width="415" height="12" font="0">commentary that is printed is that of syndicated columnists distributed nationwide</text>
<text top="392" left="108" width="415" height="12" font="0">and, as a result, we are told, on national and world issues there tends to be a</text>
<text top="407" left="108" width="415" height="12" font="0">homogeneity of editorial opinion, commentary, and interpretive analysis. The abuses</text>
<text top="423" left="108" width="415" height="12" font="0">of bias and manipulative reportage are, likewise, said to be the result of the vast</text>
<text top="438" left="108" width="415" height="12" font="0">accumulations of unreviewable power in the modem media empires. In effect, it is</text>
<text top="453" left="108" width="415" height="12" font="0">claimed, the public has lost any ability to respond or to contribute in a meaningful</text>
<text top="469" left="108" width="415" height="12" font="0">way to the debate on issues.... The obvious solution, which was available to dissidents</text>
<text top="484" left="108" width="415" height="12" font="0">at an earlier time when entry into publishing was relatively inexpensive, today would</text>
<text top="500" left="108" width="415" height="12" font="0">be to have additional newspapers. But the same economic factors which have caused</text>
<text top="515" left="108" width="235" height="12" font="0">the disappearance of vast numbers of metropoli-</text>
<text top="546" left="108" width="415" height="12" font="0">tan newspapers, have made entry into the market place of ideas served by the print</text>
<text top="561" left="108" width="415" height="12" font="0">media almost impossible. It is urged that the claim of newspapers to be &#34;surrogates</text>
<text top="577" left="108" width="415" height="12" font="0">for the public&#34; carries with it a concomitant fiduciary obligation to account for that</text>
<text top="592" left="108" width="415" height="12" font="0">stewardship. From this premise it is reasoned that the only effective way to insure</text>
<text top="607" left="108" width="415" height="12" font="0">fairness and accuracy and to provide for some accountability is for government to</text>
<text top="623" left="108" width="415" height="12" font="0">take affirmative action. The First Amendment interest of the public in being informed</text>
<text top="638" left="108" width="415" height="12" font="0">is said to be in peril because the &#34;marketplace of ideas &#34; is today a monopoly</text>

<text top="192" left="72" width="156" height="12" font="0">turn to the issues arising herein.</text>
<text top="222" left="72" width="325" height="12" font="0">The Nature of grounds specified in Article 19(2) of the Constitution</text>
<text top="253" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">192. A look at the grounds in clause (2) of Article 19, in the interests of which a law can be made</text>
<text top="269" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">placing reasonable restrictions upon the freedom of speech and expression goes to show that they</text>
<text top="284" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">are all conceived in the national interest as well as in the interest of society. The first set of grounds,</text>
<text top="299" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">viz., the sovereignty and in- tegrity of India, the security of the State, friendly relations with foreign</text>
<text top="315" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">States and public order are grounds referable to national interest whereas the second set of grounds,</text>
<text top="330" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">viz., decency, morality, contempt of court, defamation and incitement to offence are conceived in the</text>
<text top="346" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">interest of society. The inter-connection and the inter- dependence of freedom of speech and the</text>
<text top="361" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">stability of society is undeniable. They indeed contribute to and promote each other. Freedom of</text>
<text top="376" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">speech and expression in a democracy ensures that the change desired by the people, whether in</text>
<text top="392" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">political, economic or social sphere, is brought about peacefully and through law. That change</text>
<text top="407" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">desired by the people can be brought about in an orderly, legal and peaceful manner is by itself an</text>
<text top="423" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">assurance of stability and an insurance against violent upheavals which are the hall- mark of</text>
<text top="438" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">societies ruled by dictatorships, which do not permit this freedom. The stability of, say, the British</text>
<text top="453" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">nation and the periodic convulsions witnessed in the dictatorships around the world is ample proof</text>
<text top="469" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">of this truism. The converse is equally true. The more stable the society is, the more scope, it</text>
<text top="484" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">provides for exercise of right of free speech and expression. A society which feels secure can and</text>
<text top="500" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">does permit a greater latitude than a society whose stability is in constant peril. As observed by Lord</text>
<text top="515" left="72" width="284" height="12" font="0">Sumner in Bowman v. Secular Society Ltd. (1917 A.C.406):</text>

<text top="561" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">proportion as society is stable or insecure in fact, or is believed by its reasonable members to be</text>
<text top="577" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">open to assault. In the present day meetings or processions are held lawful which a hundred and</text>

<text top="176" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">people obtain the bulk of their information on matters of contemporary interest from the</text>

<text top="222" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">The television is unique in the way in which it intrudes into our homes. The combination of picture</text>
<text top="238" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">and voice makes it an irresistibly attractive medium of presentation. Call it idiot box or by any other</text>
<text top="253" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">pejorative name, it has a tremendous appeal and influence over millions of people. Many of them</text>
<text top="269" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">are glued to it for hours on end each day. Television is shaping the food habits, cultural values, social</text>
<text top="284" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">mores and what not of the society in a manner no other medium has done so far. Younger</text>

<text top="315" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">good as also for doing immense harm to the society. It depends upon how it is used. With the</text>
<text top="330" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">advance of technology, the number of channels available has grown enormously. National borders</text>
<text top="346" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">have become meaningless. The reach of some of the major networks is international they are not</text>
<text top="361" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">confined to one country or one region. It is no longer possible for any government to control or</text>

<text top="392" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">technological revolution is forcing inter-nationalism upon the world. No nation can remain a</text>
<text top="407" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">fortress or an island in itself any longer. Without a doubt, this technological revolution is presenting</text>
<text top="423" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">new issues, complex in nature - in the words of Burger,C.J., &#34;complex problems with many hard</text>
<text top="438" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">questions and few easy answers&#34;. Broadcasting media by its very nature is different from Press.</text>
<text top="453" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">Airwaves are public property. The fact that a large number of frequencies/channels are available</text>
<text top="469" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">does not make them anytheless public property. It is the obligation of the State under our</text>
<text top="484" left="72" width="320" height="12" font="0">constitutional system to ensure that they are used for public good.</text>
<text top="515" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">198. Now, what does this public good mean and signify in the context of the broadcasting medium?</text>
<text top="530" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">In a democracy, people govern themselves and they cannot govern themselves properly unless they</text>
<text top="546" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">are aware - aware of social, political, economic and other issues confronting them. To enable them</text>
<text top="561" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">to make a proper judgment on those issues, they must have the benefit of a range of opinions on</text>
<text top="577" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">those issues. Right to receive and impart information is implicit in free speech. This plurality of</text>
<text top="592" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">opinions, views and ideas is indispensable for enabling them to make an informed judgment on</text>
<text top="607" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">those issues to know what is their true interest, to make them responsible citizens, to safeguard their</text>
<text top="623" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">rights as also the interests of society and State. All the constitutional courts of leading democracies,</text>
<text top="638" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">reference to which has been made hereinbefore, have recognised and reiterated this aspect. This is</text>
<text top="654" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">also the view of the European Court of Human Rights. In Castells v. Spain (14 EHRR 445) - quoted</text>

<text top="68" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">viewers and not the right of the broadcaster - whether the broadcaster is the State, public</text>
<text top="84" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">corporation or a private individual or body. A monopoly over broadcasting, whether by government</text>
<text top="99" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">or by anybody else, Is inconsistent with the free speech right of the citizens. State control really</text>
<text top="115" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">means governmental control, which in turn means, control of the political party or parties in power</text>
<text top="130" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">for the time being. Such control is bound to colour the views, information and opinions conveyed by</text>
<text top="145" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">the media. The free speech right of the citizens is better served in keeping the broadcasting media</text>
<text top="161" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">under the control of public. Control by public means control by an independent public corporation</text>
<text top="176" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">or corporations, as the case may be, formed under a statute. As held by the Constitutional Court of</text>
<text top="192" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">Italy, broadcasting provides an essential service in a democratic society and could legitimately be</text>
<text top="207" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">reserved for a public institution, provided certain conditions are met. The corporation(s) must be</text>
<text top="222" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">constituted and composed in such a manner as to ensure its independence from government and its</text>
<text top="238" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">impartiality on public issues. When presenting or discussing a public issue, it must be ensured that</text>
<text top="253" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">all aspects of it are presented in a balanced manner, without appearing to espouse any one point of</text>
<text top="269" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">view. This will also enhance the credibility of the media to a very large extent; a controlled media</text>
<text top="284" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">cannot command that level of credibility. For the purpose of ensuring the free speech rights of the</text>
<text top="299" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">citizens guaranteed by Article 19(1)(a), it is not necessary to have private broadcasting stations, as</text>
<text top="315" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">held by the Constitutional Courts of France and Italy. Allowing private broadcasting would be to</text>
<text top="330" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">open the door for powerful economic, commercial and political interests, which may not prove</text>
<text top="346" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">beneficial to free speech right of the citizens - and certainly so, if strict programme controls and</text>
<text top="361" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">other controls are not prescribed. The analogy with press is wholly inapt. Above all, airwaves</text>
<text top="376" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">constitute public property. While, the freedom guaranteed by Article 19(1)(a) does include the right</text>
<text top="392" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">to receive and impart information, no one can claim the fundamental right to do so by using or</text>
<text top="407" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">employing public property. Only where the statute permits him to use the public property, then only</text>
<text top="423" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">- and subject to such conditions and restrictions as the law may impose - he can use the public</text>
<text top="438" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">property, viz., airwaves. In other words, Article 19(1)(a) does not enable a citizen to impart his</text>
<text top="453" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">information, views and opinions by using the airwaves. He can do so without using the airwaves. It</text>
<text top="469" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">need not be emphasised that while broadcasting cannot be effected without using airwaves,</text>
<text top="484" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">receiving the broadcast does not involve any such use. Airwaves, being public property must be</text>
<text top="500" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">utilised to advance public good. Public good lies in ensuring plurality of opinions, views and ideas</text>
<text top="515" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">and that would scarcely be served by private broadcasters, who would be and who are bound to be</text>
<text top="530" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">actuated by profit motive. There is a far greater likelihood of these private broadcasters indulging in</text>

<text top="592" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">while denying it at the national level should serve as a lesson; this limited opening has given rise to</text>

<text top="623" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">counter-productive at the present juncture of our development; the implementation machinery in</text>

<text top="238" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">implicit in it, private broadcasting is not. Matters of policy are for the Parliament to consider and</text>
<text top="253" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">not for courts. On account of historical fac- tors, radio and television have remained in the hands of</text>

<text top="361" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">Article 19(1)(a) stands on a different footing. The petitioners - or the potential applicants for private</text>

<text top="438" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">200. It would be appropriate at this stage to deal with the reasoning of the European Court of</text>
<text top="453" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">Human Rights in the case of Informationsverein Lentia. The first thing to be noticed in this behalf is</text>
<text top="469" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">the language of Article 10(1) of the European convention, set out hereinbefore. Clause (1) of Article</text>
<text top="484" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">10 not only says that everyone has the right to freedom of expression but also says that the said right</text>
<text top="500" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without</text>
<text top="515" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers. The clause then adds that Article 10</text>
<text top="530" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">shall not, however, prevent the State from requiring the licensing of broadcasting, television or</text>
<text top="546" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">cinema enterprises. Clause (2) of course is almost in para materia with clause (2) of Article 19 of our</text>
<text top="561" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">Constitution. What is, however, significant is that Article 10(1) expressly conferred the right &#34;to</text>
<text top="577" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority&#34;. The only power</text>
<text top="592" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">given to public authority, which in the context means the State/Government, is to provide the</text>
<text top="607" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">requirement of license and nothing more. It is this feature of clause (1) which has evidently</text>
<text top="623" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">influenced the decision of the European court. The decision cannot, therefore, be read as laying</text>
<text top="638" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">down that the right of free expression by itself implies and includes the right to establish private</text>
<text top="654" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">broadcasting stations. It is necessary to emphasise another aspect. While I agree with the statement</text>
<text top="669" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">in Para 38 to the effect that freedom of expression is fundamental to a democratic society and that</text>
<text top="684" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">the said right &#34;cannot be successfully accomplished unless it is grounded in the principle of</text>
<text top="700" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">pluralism, of which the State is the ultimate guarantor&#34;, I find it difficult to agree that such</text>
<text top="715" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">pluralism cannot be ensured by a public/statutory corporation of the nature already in existence in</text>

<text top="222" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">considered by the European Court. As has been emphasised by other constitutional courts, the very</text>
<text top="238" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">free speech interest of the citizens requires that the broadcasting media is not dominated or</text>
<text top="253" left="72" width="182" height="12" font="0">controlled by such powerful interests.</text>
<text top="284" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">201. There is yet another aspect of the petitioners' claim which requires to be explained. According</text>
<text top="299" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">to their own case, they have sold the telecasting rights with respect to their matches to a foreign</text>
<text top="315" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">agency with the understanding that such foreign agency shall bring in its own equipment and</text>
<text top="330" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">personnel and telecast the matches from the Indian territory. Once they have sold their rights, the</text>
<text top="346" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">foreign agency is not their agent but an independent party. It is a principal by itself The foreign</text>
<text top="361" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">agency cannot claim or enforce the right guaranteed by Article 19(1)(a). Petitioners cannot also</text>
<text top="376" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">claim because they have already sold the rights. In other words, the right to telecast is no longer with</text>
<text top="392" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">them but with the foreign firm which has purchased the telecasting rights. For this reason too, the</text>
<text top="407" left="72" width="245" height="12" font="0">petitioners' claim must be held to be unacceptable.</text>
<text top="438" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">202. Having held that Article 19(1)(a) does not encompass the right to establish, maintain or run</text>
<text top="453" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">broadcasting stations or broadcasting facilities, we feel it necessary to clarify the true purport of the</text>
<text top="469" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">said freedom in the context of broadcasting media. This is necessary to ensure that I am not</text>
<text top="484" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">misunderstood or misinterpreted. Indeed, what I propose to say hereafter flows logically from what</text>
<text top="500" left="72" width="108" height="12" font="0">I have said heretofore.</text>
<text top="530" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">203. It has been held by this Court in Life Insurance Corporation v. Manubhai Shah that the</text>

<text top="577" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">radio and the television. Every citizen of this free country, therefore, has the right to air his or her</text>

<text top="269" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">the same over again here. I have also mentioned hereinbefore that for ensuring plurality of views,</text>
<text top="284" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">opinions and also to ensure a fair and balanced presentation of news and public issues, the</text>
<text top="299" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">broadcast media should be placed under the control of public, i.e., in the hands of statutory</text>
<text top="315" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">corporation or corporations, as the case may be. This is the implicit command of Article 19(1)(a). I</text>
<text top="330" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">have also stressed the importance of constituting and composing these corporations in such a</text>
<text top="346" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">manner that they ensure impartiality in political, economic and social and other matters touching</text>
<text top="361" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">the public and to ensure plurality of views, opinions and ideas. This again is the implicit command</text>
<text top="376" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">of Article 19(1)(a). This medium should promote the public interest by providing information,</text>
<text top="392" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">knowledge and entertainment of good quality in a balanced way. Radio and Television should serve</text>
<text top="407" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">the role of public educators as well. Indeed, more than one corporation for each media can be</text>
<text top="423" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">provided with a view to provide competition among them (as has been done in France) or for</text>
<text top="438" left="72" width="158" height="12" font="0">convenience, as the case may be.</text>
<text top="469" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">205. Now, coming to the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, a look at its scheme and provisions would</text>
<text top="484" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">disclose that it was meant for a different purpose altogether. When it was enacted, there was neither</text>
<text top="500" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">Radio***** nor, of course, television, though it may be that radio or television fall within the</text>
<text top="515" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">definition of &#34;telegraph&#34; in Section 3(1). Except Section 4 and the definition of the expression</text>
<text top="530" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">&#34;telegraph&#34;, no other provision of the Act appears to be relevant to broadcasting media. Since the</text>
<text top="546" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">validity of Section 4(1) has not been specifically challenged before us, we decline to express any</text>
<text top="561" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">opinion thereon. The situation is undoubtedly unsatisfactory. This is the result of the legislation in</text>
<text top="577" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">this country not keeping pace with the technological developments. While all the democracies in the</text>
<text top="592" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">world have enacted laws specifically governing the broadcasting media, this country has lagged</text>
<text top="607" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">behind, rooted in the Telegraph Act of 1885 which is wholly inadequate and unsuited to an</text>
<text top="623" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">important medium like radio and television, i.e., broadcasting media. It is absolutely essential, in</text>

<text top="638" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">agency. They have parted with the right. The right to telecast the matches, including the right to</text>
<text top="654" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">import, install and operate the requisite equipment is thus really sought by the foreign agencies and</text>
<text top="669" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">not by the petitioners. Hence, the question of violation of their right under Article 19(1)(a) resulting</text>

<text top="53" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">2. The Government monopoly of broadcasting media in this country is the result of historical and</text>
<text top="68" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">other factors. This is true of every other country, to start with. That India was not a free country till</text>
<text top="84" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">1947 and its citizens did not have constitutionally guaranteed fundamental freedoms till 1950</text>
<text top="99" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">coupled with the fact that our Constitution is Just about forty five years into operation explains the</text>
<text top="115" left="72" width="479" height="12" font="0">Government monopoly. As pointed out in the body of the judgment, broadcasting media was a mo-</text>
<text top="145" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">nopoly of the Government, to start with, in every country except the United States where a conscious</text>
<text top="161" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">decision was taken at the very beginning not to have State monopoly over the medium. Until</text>
<text top="176" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">recently, the broadcasting media has been in the hands of public/statutory corporations in most of</text>
<text top="192" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">the West European countries. Private broadcasting is comparatively a recent phenomenon. The</text>
<text top="207" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">experience in Italy of allowing private broadcasting at local level (while prohibiting it at national</text>
<text top="222" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">level) has left much to be desired. It has given rise to powerful media empires which development is</text>
<text top="238" left="72" width="281" height="12" font="0">certainly not conducive to free speech right of the citizens.</text>
<text top="269" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">3 (a). It has been held by this Court - and rightly - that broadcasting media is affected by the free</text>
<text top="284" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">speech right of the citizens guaranteed by Article 19(1)(a). This is also the view expressed by all the</text>
<text top="299" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">Constitutional Courts whose opinions have been referred to in the body of the judgment. Once this</text>
<text top="315" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">is so, monopoly of this medium (broadcasting media), whether by Government or by an individual,</text>
<text top="330" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">body or Organisation is unacceptable. Clause (2) of Article 19 does not permit a monopoly in the</text>
<text top="346" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">matter of freedom of speech and expression as is permitted by clause (6) of Article 19 vis-a-vis the</text>
<text top="361" left="72" width="174" height="12" font="0">right guaranteed by Article 19(1)(g).</text>
<text top="392" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">(b) The right of free speech and expression includes the right to receive and impart information. For</text>
<text top="407" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">ensuring the free speech right of the citizens of this country, it is necessary that the citizens have the</text>
<text top="423" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">benefit of plurality of views and a range of opinions on all public issues. A successful democracy</text>
<text top="438" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">posits an 'aware' citizenry. Diversity of opinions, views, ideas and ideologies is essential to enable</text>
<text top="453" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">the citizens to arrive at informed judgment on all issues touching them. This cannot be provided by</text>
<text top="469" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">a medium controlled by a monopoly - whether the monopoly is of the State or any other individual,</text>
<text top="484" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">group or Organisation. As a matter of fact, private broadcasting stations may perhaps be more</text>
<text top="500" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">prejudicial to free speech right of the citizens than the government controlled media, as explained in</text>
<text top="515" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">the body of the judgment. The broadcasting media should be under the control of the public as</text>
<text top="530" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">distinct from Government. This is the command implicit in Article 19(1)(a). It should be operated by</text>
<text top="546" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">a public statutory corporation or corporations, as the case may be, whose constitution and</text>
<text top="561" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">composition must be such as to ensure its/their impartiality in political, economic and social</text>
<text top="577" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">matters and on all other public issues. It/they must be required by law to present news, views and</text>
<text top="592" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">opinions in a balanced way ensuring pluralism and diversity of opinions and views. It/they must</text>
<text top="607" left="72" width="355" height="12" font="0">provide equal access to all the citizens and groups to avail of the medium.</text>
<text top="638" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">4. The Indian Telegraph Act, 1885 is totally inadequate to govern an important medium like the</text>
<text top="654" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">radio and television, i.e., broadcasting media. The Act was intended for an altogether different</text>
<text top="669" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">purpose when it was enacted. This is the result of the law in this country not keeping pace with the</text>
<text top="684" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">technological advances in the field of information and communications. While all the leading</text>
<text top="700" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">democratic countries have enacted laws specifically governing the broadcasting media, the law in</text>

<text top="469" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">permission to the organisers to engage an agency of their own for the purpose. Of course, it would be</text>
<text top="484" left="72" width="487" height="12" font="0">equally open to the nodal Ministry (Government of India) to permit such foreign agency in addition</text>

<text top="205" left="57" width="487" height="13" font="0">disappearances, the State established a special commission “empowered to acknowledge the </text>

<text top="290" left="57" width="487" height="13" font="0">operations carried out–  that would enable graves to be located.  Similarly, the law would be </text>

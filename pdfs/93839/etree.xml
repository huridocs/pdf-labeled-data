<text top="268" left="57" width="503" height="13" font="2">2. The petitioners allege that Jorge Omar Gutiérrez, then a Deputy-Captain (<i>Subcomisario</i>) of the </text>
<text top="280" left="57" width="503" height="13" font="2">Police of the Province of Buenos Aires, was killed on August 29, 1994 by state agents, namely a </text>

<text top="304" left="57" width="503" height="13" font="2">corruption involving high-ranking government officials and large sums of money. The petitioners </text>
<text top="316" left="57" width="504" height="13" font="2">contend that the investigation of the killing was obstructed by the Federal Police, and that the </text>
<text top="329" left="57" width="505" height="13" font="2">prosecution of the presumed killer was partial and deficient to the point of allowing those </text>
<text top="341" left="57" width="504" height="13" font="2">responsible to escape punishment and denying justice to the Gutiérrez family. The petitioners </text>
<text top="353" left="57" width="506" height="13" font="2">emphasize that their contentions are supported by the findings of a Special Investigative </text>
<text top="365" left="57" width="503" height="13" font="2">Commission of the National Chamber of Deputies constituted to investigate alleged corruption in </text>
<text top="377" left="57" width="502" height="13" font="2">the customs administration.  The petitioners maintain that the facts alleged constitute violations of </text>
<text top="389" left="57" width="503" height="13" font="2">the rights to life, and judicial protection and guarantees, as well as of the State’s obligation to </text>

<text top="500" left="57" width="503" height="13" font="2">indicates that because its competent authorities continue to investigate, the applicable domestic </text>
<text top="513" left="57" width="503" height="13" font="2">remedies have yet to be exhausted and the rights to judicial protection and guarantees are being </text>

<text top="394" left="57" width="503" height="13" font="2">16.  The judicial investigation was conducted by the Fifth Criminal and Correctional Court of the </text>
<text top="407" left="57" width="502" height="13" font="2">City of La Plata.  The petitioners allege that it was deficient from the start, indicating, for example, </text>
<text top="419" left="57" width="502" height="13" font="2">that investigators failed to note or attribute importance to certain evidence. They note that, while </text>
<text top="431" left="57" width="503" height="13" font="2">the initial theory pursued was that the victim had been killed by a stray bullet fired from outside </text>
<text top="443" left="57" width="503" height="13" font="2">the train, it was clear to anyone who examined the position of the body and the entry and exit </text>
<text top="455" left="57" width="505" height="13" font="2">wounds that he had been killed by a shot fired at close range from behind.  The bullet was </text>
<text top="467" left="57" width="502" height="13" font="2">allegedly fired from a distance of less that 50 cm., entered at the base of the neck and exited near </text>
<text top="479" left="57" width="502" height="13" font="2">the forehead–what the petitioners call a “death shot” (“<i>tiro de la muerte</i>”), premeditated and </text>
<text top="492" left="57" width="503" height="13" font="2">intended to kill.  The petitioners note that other similarly unfounded theories were propounded in </text>
<text top="504" left="57" width="155" height="13" font="2">the effort to obscure the truth.</text>

<text top="542" left="57" width="504" height="13" font="2">Ramón (“David”) Silva,  was located not by the police but by the family of the victim.  In his </text>
<text top="554" left="57" width="502" height="13" font="2">statement to the authorities, he indicated that the killers had been two members of the Argentine </text>
<text top="566" left="57" width="502" height="13" font="2">Federal Police, nicknamed “Chiquito” and “Colorado.”  He said the two were seen on the trains </text>
<text top="578" left="57" width="502" height="13" font="2">every Friday at a certain hour, requiring roving vendors such as himself to pay a ten-peso bribe. </text>
<text top="590" left="57" width="503" height="13" font="2">He indicated that those who didn’t pay had their merchandise confiscated and were detained for </text>
<text top="603" left="57" width="502" height="13" font="2">24 hours. He said it was Chiquito–whom he subsequently identified as Alejandro Daniel Santillán, </text>
<text top="615" left="57" width="503" height="13" font="2">a member of the Federal Police--who had shot Gutiérrez.  Silva partially retracted his statement </text>
<text top="627" left="57" width="504" height="13" font="2">during the trial, but later testified before the Special Investigative Commission of the National </text>
<text top="639" left="57" width="503" height="13" font="2">Chamber of Deputies that the retraction had been prepared with Santillan’s lawyers after having </text>

<text top="143" left="57" width="503" height="13" font="2">According to these versions, the two men spoke, then Santillán passed by and turned around to </text>

<text top="193" left="57" width="502" height="13" font="2">on September 23, 1994, the SSF-PFA presented declarations given by two minors implicating two </text>
<text top="205" left="57" width="503" height="13" font="2">other individuals in the killing. The minors recanted during the trial, as well as before the Special </text>
<text top="218" left="57" width="505" height="13" font="2">Investigative Commission of the National Chamber of Deputies, alleging that they had been </text>
<text top="230" left="57" width="503" height="13" font="2">tortured by the same two agents of the SSF-PF identified by witness David Silva as his torturers. </text>
<text top="242" left="57" width="504" height="13" font="2">The petitioners maintain that the investigation opened against the two agents in question has </text>
<text top="254" left="57" width="485" height="13" font="2">produced no results, nor has any police officer ever been disciplined in relation to these events. </text>

<text top="292" left="57" width="504" height="13" font="2">hearing in his trial was held on November 11 and 12, 1996.  He was absolved on the basis of </text>

<text top="316" left="57" width="503" height="13" font="2">result of the partial retraction by witness Silva, other doubts in relation to the testimony of Silva </text>
<text top="329" left="57" width="350" height="13" font="2">and Chumbita, and the alibi provided by his partner and her mother. </text>

<text top="367" left="57" width="502" height="13" font="2">the Federal Police, which was patently obvious at the time of the trial, but was disregarded by the </text>
<text top="379" left="57" width="503" height="13" font="2">judiciary and has remained unanswered. They argue that the judiciary, for its part, conducted an </text>
<text top="391" left="57" width="503" height="13" font="2">investigation that was incomplete and deficient.  The petitioners emphasize that no serious effort </text>
<text top="403" left="57" width="504" height="13" font="2">was made to identify the other alleged perpetrator referred to as “Colorado,” notwithstanding </text>
<text top="415" left="57" width="506" height="13" font="2">physical descriptions and related information provided by various  witnesses.  These factors </text>
<text top="428" left="57" width="503" height="13" font="2">ensured a prosecution that was partial and defective.  Accordingly, they maintain that the State </text>
<text top="440" left="57" width="504" height="13" font="2">failed to comply with its obligations to investigate the killing, and prosecute and punish those </text>
<text top="452" left="57" width="221" height="13" font="2">responsible in accordance with due process.</text>

<text top="478" left="57" width="502" height="13" font="2">23. The petitioners emphasize that their position with respect to the investigation and prosecution </text>
<text top="490" left="57" width="504" height="13" font="2">draws from and is supported by the findings of the “Special Investigative Commission on the </text>
<text top="502" left="57" width="509" height="13" font="2">probable commission of illegal acts perpetrated or produced in the National Customs </text>

<text top="514" left="163" width="397" height="13" font="2">formed by the Chamber of Deputies of the National Congress of Argentina. </text>
<text top="526" left="57" width="503" height="13" font="2">They report that the Special Commission found serious irregularities in the investigation into the </text>
<text top="539" left="57" width="502" height="13" font="2">killing of Jorge Omar Gutiérrez, and for that reason addressed the President of the Supreme Court </text>
<text top="551" left="57" width="502" height="13" font="2">of Justice of Buenos Aires to request that consideration be given to reopening the investigation. </text>
<text top="563" left="57" width="502" height="13" font="2">The petitioners further note that one of the judges who tried Alejandro Daniel Santillán referred in </text>
<text top="575" left="57" width="506" height="13" font="2">the sentence itself to investigative deficiencies that had impeded his ability to come to a </text>
<text top="587" left="57" width="505" height="13" font="2">conclusion about  responsibility for the crime. In this sense, the petitioners contend that the </text>
<text top="599" left="57" width="408" height="13" font="2">human rights violations they set forth have in fact been recognized by the State.</text>
<text top="602" left="464" width="3" height="11" font="3"> </text>

<text top="637" left="57" width="506" height="13" font="2">particular, because the domestic remedies corresponding to their claims were invoked and </text>
<text top="650" left="57" width="503" height="13" font="2">exhausted with the final sentence confirming the absolution of Santillán. With their presentations, </text>
<text top="662" left="57" width="504" height="13" font="2">the petitioners included a copy of the sentence issued by the First Court of the Chamber of </text>

<text top="698" left="57" width="504" height="13" font="2">killing of Deputy-Captain Gutiérrez was reopened pursuant to written requests for investigative </text>
<text top="710" left="57" width="503" height="13" font="2">measures by the family, it has produced no advances. Further, while several cases were opened </text>

<text top="84" left="57" width="3" height="11" font="3"> </text>
<text top="94" left="57" width="503" height="13" font="2">25. Finally, the petitioners contend that, because the State failed to file its response before the </text>
<text top="107" left="57" width="506" height="13" font="2">Commission within the initial 90 days provided, it thereby waived its right to contest the </text>
<text top="119" left="57" width="503" height="13" font="2">admissibility of the claims or  controvert the facts alleged. Citing Article 42 of the Commission’s </text>
<text top="131" left="57" width="503" height="13" font="2">former Regulations, and Article 39 of the current Rules of Procedure, as well as case law of the </text>
<text top="143" left="57" width="503" height="13" font="2">Inter-American Court of Human Rights, they argue that any allegations on the part of the State </text>
<text top="155" left="57" width="503" height="13" font="2">with respect to the nonexhaustion of domestic remedies should have been filed within that first </text>
<text top="167" left="57" width="503" height="13" font="2">opportunity, and that the delay in the State’s response means it waived its right to contest the </text>
<text top="180" left="57" width="259" height="13" font="2">allegations of law and fact set forth in the petition. </text>

<text top="205" left="57" width="15" height="13" font="1"><b>B. </b></text>
<text top="205" left="92" width="57" height="13" font="1"><b>The State </b></text>
<text top="208" left="149" width="3" height="11" font="3"> </text>
<text top="221" left="57" width="3" height="11" font="3"> </text>
<text top="231" left="57" width="504" height="13" font="2">26.  The State’s position may be summarized in six points.  First, the State contends that the </text>
<text top="244" left="57" width="502" height="13" font="2">petitioners’ claims concerning the absolution of Alejandro Daniel Santillán due to insufficient proof </text>
<text top="256" left="57" width="506" height="13" font="2">are inadmissible because they would require the Commission to act as a so-called “fourth </text>
<text top="268" left="57" width="505" height="13" font="2">instance” of review. The State maintains that the judicial process against Santillán, and the </text>
<text top="280" left="57" width="504" height="13" font="2">investigation which preceded it, were carried out by the appropriate jurisdictional organs acting </text>
<text top="292" left="57" width="503" height="13" font="2">within the spheres of their competence and in accordance with domestic law. For the Commission </text>
<text top="304" left="57" width="503" height="13" font="2">to review this process would be for it to intervene in assessments of fact and internal law that </text>
<text top="316" left="57" width="502" height="13" font="2">properly correspond to the domestic legal system.  The State emphasizes that the trial of Santillán </text>
<text top="329" left="57" width="504" height="13" font="2">produced his absolution because the prosecution was unable to produce sufficient evidence to </text>
<text top="341" left="57" width="503" height="13" font="2">overcome the presumption of innocence in his favor, and took place with the full participation of </text>
<text top="353" left="57" width="234" height="13" font="2">the parties, including the family of the victim. </text>
<text top="355" left="290" width="3" height="11" font="3"> </text>
<text top="368" left="57" width="3" height="11" font="3"> </text>
<text top="379" left="57" width="503" height="13" font="2">27.  Second, the State notes that, while the absolution of Alejandro Daniel Santillán produced a </text>
<text top="391" left="57" width="503" height="13" font="2">final decision that is now <i>res judicata</i>, that decision only closed the inquiry as far as that accused </text>
<text top="403" left="57" width="502" height="13" font="2">was concerned.  The State indicates in this regard that the investigation process into the death of </text>
<text top="415" left="57" width="504" height="13" font="2">the Deputy-Captain was reopened at the request of the Prosecutor’s Office, and remains open, </text>
<text top="428" left="57" width="507" height="13" font="2">and that the Gutiérrez family continues to participate in it as a party. Accordingly, the </text>
<text top="440" left="57" width="503" height="13" font="2">investigation can follow its course if new evidence becomes available. The State thus concludes </text>
<text top="452" left="57" width="506" height="13" font="2">that the prosecution of Santillán and the ongoing investigation demonstrate that domestic </text>
<text top="464" left="57" width="232" height="13" font="2">remedies have proven available and effective.</text>
<text top="466" left="288" width="3" height="11" font="3"> </text>
<text top="479" left="57" width="3" height="11" font="3"> </text>
<text top="490" left="57" width="503" height="13" font="2">28. Third, the State argues that the petitioners’ claims concerning the right to life in the present </text>
<text top="502" left="57" width="503" height="13" font="2">petition are manifestly unfounded.  The State characterizes the petitioners’ positions with respect </text>
<text top="514" left="57" width="503" height="13" font="2">to the motives for the killing and responsibility of state agents as speculative, and maintains that </text>
<text top="526" left="57" width="503" height="13" font="2">they have provided no basis in law or fact to demonstrate the participation of any state agent in </text>
<text top="539" left="57" width="503" height="13" font="2">the killing of Deputy-Captain Gutiérrez, or the failure of the domestic legal system to respond to </text>
<text top="551" left="57" width="55" height="13" font="2">the crime. </text>
<text top="553" left="111" width="3" height="11" font="3"> </text>
<text top="566" left="57" width="3" height="11" font="3"> </text>
<text top="577" left="57" width="505" height="13" font="2">29.  Fourth, the State notes that its authorities have demonstrated their commitment to this </text>
<text top="589" left="57" width="503" height="13" font="2">situation in various ways.  It reports, for example, that the Police of the Province of Buenos Aires </text>
<text top="601" left="57" width="506" height="13" font="2">modified the administrative classification of Gutiérrez’ death--initially listed as unrelated to </text>
<text top="613" left="57" width="503" height="13" font="2">service--to being imputable to his service, thereby giving rise to a right to compensation for his </text>
<text top="625" left="57" width="504" height="13" font="2">heirs.  (The State notes that this administrative evaluation in no way implies any acceptance of </text>
<text top="637" left="57" width="503" height="13" font="2">responsibility by the Province with respect to the present petition.)  The State further notes the </text>
<text top="650" left="57" width="503" height="13" font="2">actions of the Special Investigative Commission of the National Chamber of Deputies as evidence </text>
<text top="662" left="57" width="245" height="13" font="2">of its interest in the full resolution of the matter.</text>
<text top="664" left="302" width="3" height="11" font="3"> </text>
<text top="677" left="57" width="3" height="11" font="3"> </text>
<text top="688" left="57" width="504" height="13" font="2">30.  Fifth, the State indicates that the petitioners themselves have demonstrated that domestic </text>
<text top="700" left="57" width="504" height="13" font="2">remedies have yet to be exhausted, as they continue to pursue their claims before both the </text>
<text top="712" left="57" width="505" height="13" font="2">domestic judicial authorities and  the Inter-American Commission.  The State characterizes the </text>
</page>
<page number="6" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="792" width="612">
<text top="736" left="303" width="8" height="14" font="0">6 </text>
<text top="750" left="57" width="2" height="14" font="0"> </text>
<text top="56" left="57" width="506" height="13" font="2">petitioners’ actions in this regard as contradictory, indicating that had the petitioners truly </text>
<text top="69" left="57" width="502" height="13" font="2">exhausted the available domestic remedies they would no longer be participating in the ongoing </text>
<text top="81" left="57" width="504" height="13" font="2">judicial investigation. Rather, the State maintains that the petitioners have manifested nothing </text>
<text top="93" left="57" width="504" height="13" font="2">more than their disagreement with the results of certain aspects of the jurisdictional process. </text>
<text top="105" left="57" width="502" height="13" font="2">Thus, the State concludes that the petitioners have failed to exhaust domestic remedies, or to set </text>
<text top="117" left="57" width="503" height="13" font="2">forth any violation of the rights to judicial protection and guarantees under Articles 8 and 25 of </text>
<text top="129" left="57" width="503" height="13" font="2">the Convention. The State emphasizes that the duty to investigate is one of means rather than </text>
<text top="141" left="57" width="309" height="13" font="2">results, and has been fully complied with in the present case.</text>
<text top="144" left="366" width="3" height="11" font="3"> </text>
<text top="157" left="57" width="3" height="11" font="3"> </text>
<text top="167" left="57" width="504" height="13" font="2">31.  Sixth, with respect to the petitioners’ allegations that the State’s failure to respond to the </text>
